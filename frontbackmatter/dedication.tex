  \textit{My mother, Joy Colleen Berkey Madsen (1944-2005),  encouraged me from the earliest age in a love of learning, not merely because it would lead to opportunity, but because knowledge and learning were important values in and of themselves.  Her own  opportunities for higher education were limited by the need to support herself from a young age, and then by the need to work and support her family, but she supported my education in every way possible.}\\

  \textit{This dissertation is both dedicated to her, and many ways a joint accomplishment.}
