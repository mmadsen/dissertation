%\epigraph{\vspace{8.55cm}``Computing Science is no more about computers than Astronomy is about telescopes.''}{\Dijkstra}


\epigraph{\vspace{1cm}``There are really only individuals in nature\ldots genera, orders, and classes exist only in our imagination.''}{Georges-Louis Buffon, \emph{Histoire Naturelle}, Volume 1, 1749--1804}


\epigraph{\vspace{1cm}``We cannot improve the language of any science without at the same time improving the science itself.\ldots Neither can we, on the other hand, improve a science, without improving the language or nomenclature which belongs to it.''}{Antoine Lavoisier, \emph{Elements of Chemistry}, 1789}



\epigraph{\vspace{1cm}``It is not always appreciated that the problem of theory building is a constant interaction between constructing laws and finding an appropriate set of descriptive state variables [units] such that laws can be constructed.  We cannot go out and describe the world in any old way we please and then sit back and demand that an explanatory and predictive theory be built on that description \ldots That is not to say that there is an insoluable contradiction. Rather there is a process of trial and synthesis going on in which both state descriptions and laws are being fitted together\ldots''}{\Lewontin, \citeyearpar{Lewontin1974}}
