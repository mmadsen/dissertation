	Abstract = {Anthropologists have adopted methods from population genetics to study
	modes of cultural transmission in time-transgressive cultural data
	sets. However, it remains unclear to what extent methods originally
	developed to assess neutrality in genes sampled from a population
	at a single point in time are applicable to cultural variants sampled
	from assemblages. This report applies a suite of previously published
	methods to assemblages formed under unbiased cultural transmission.
	The results show that, even under the controlled conditions afforded
	by computer simulation, all but one method (the variants frequency
	approach) fail to identify unbiased cultural transmission in samples
	collected from moderately to severely time-averaged assemblages.
	While it is encouraging that the method that is best at identifying
	unbiased cultural transmission in simulated time-averaged data also
	is relatively robust to relative sample size, additional work is
	needed to determine whether even the variants frequency approach

@article{lipomadsendunnell2015,
	Abstract = {<p>Frequency seriation played a key role in the formation of archaeology as a discipline due to its ability to generate chronologies. Interest in its utility for exploring issues of contemporary interest beyond chronology, however, has been limited. This limitation is partly due to a lack of quantitative algorithms that can be used to build deterministic seriation solutions. When the number of assemblages becomes greater than just a handful, the resources required for evaluation of possible permutations easily outstrips available computing capacity. On the other hand, probabilistic approaches to creating seriations offer a computationally manageable alternative but rely upon a compressed description of the data to order assemblages. This compression removes the ability to use all of the features of our data to fit to the seriation model, obscuring violations of the model, and thus lessens our ability to understand the degree to which the resulting order is chronological, spatial, or a mixture. Recently, frequency seriation has been reconceived as a general method for studying the structure of cultural transmission through time and across space. The use of an evolution-based framework renews the potential for seriation but also calls for a computationally feasible algorithm that is capable of producing solutions under varying configurations, without manual trial and error fitting. Here, we introduce the Iterative Deterministic Seriation Solution (IDSS) for constructing frequency seriations, an algorithm that dramatically constrains the search for potential valid orders of assemblages. Our initial implementation of IDSS does not solve all the problems of seriation, but begins to moves towards a resolution of a long-standing problem in archaeology while opening up new avenues of research into the study of cultural relatedness. We demonstrate the utility of IDSS using late prehistoric decorated ceramics from the Mississippi River Valley. The results compare favorably to previous analyses but add new details into the structure of cultural transmission of these late prehistoric populations.</p>},
