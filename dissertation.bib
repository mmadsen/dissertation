@article{khromov2018,
	Abstract = {In considering evolution of transcribed regions, regulatory sequences, and other genomic loci, we are often faced with a situation in which the number of allelic states greatly exceeds the size of the population. In this limit, the population eventually adopts a steady state characterized by mutation-selection-drift balance. Although new alleles continue to be explored through mutation, the statistics of the population, and in particular the probabilities of seeing specific allelic configurations in samples taken from the population, do not change with time. In the absence of selection, the probabilities of allelic configurations are given by the Ewens sampling formula, widely used in population genetics to detect deviations from neutrality. Here we develop an extension of this formula to arbitrary fitness distributions. Although our approach is general, we focus on the class of fitness landscapes, inspired by recent high-throughput genotype-phenotype maps, in which alleles can be in several distinct phenotypic states. This class of landscapes yields sampling probabilities that are computationally more tractable and can form a basis for inference of selection signatures from genomic data. Using an efficient numerical implementation of the sampling probabilities, we demonstrate that, for a sizable range of mutation rates and selection coefficients, the steady-state allelic diversity is not neutral. Therefore, it may be used to infer selection coefficients, as well as other evolutionary parameters from population data. We also carry out numerical simulations to challenge various approximations involved in deriving our sampling formulas, such as the infinite-allele limit and the ``full connectivity'' assumption inherent in the Ewens theory, in which each allele can mutate into any other allele. We find that, at least for the specific numerical examples studied, our theory remains sufficiently accurate even if these assumptions are relaxed. Thus our framework establishes both theoretical and practical foundations for inferring selection signatures from population-level genomic sequence samples.},

	Abstract = {{Many fields of evolutionary biology now depend on stochastic mathematical models. These models are valuable for their ability to formalize predictions in the face of uncertainty and provide a quantitative framework for testing hypotheses. However, no mathematical model will fully capture biological complexity. Instead, these models attempt to capture the important features of biological systems using relatively simple mathematical principles. These simplifications can allow us to focus on differences that are meaningful, while ignoring those that are not. However, simplification also requires assumptions, and to the extent that these are wrong, so is our ability to predict or compare. Here, we discuss approaches for evaluating the performance of evolutionary models in light of their assumptions by comparing them against reality. We highlight general approaches, how they are applied, and remaining opportunities. Absolute tests of fit, even when not explicitly framed as such, are fundamental to progress in understanding evolution.}},

	Abstract = { Cultural artefacts, like genes and languages, reflect their history. The methodology of inference of that history, however, has been a contentious question. Recent applications of biological phylogenetic methodology to infer historical patterns of material culture are often explicitly justified on the grounds that essentially similar processes underlie evolution in both biological and material cultural realms. Conventional phylogenetic techniques, while helpful in some cases, do not provide a general theoretical and operational framewok for reconstructing material cultural history. Critical analyses of the diversity patterns of two musical instruments, the stringed psaltery and the brasswind cornet, reveal paths of information transfer and the origins of innovation unique to the cultural context that are unlike those in biological systems. },

	Abstract = {{Incomplete lineage sorting can cause incongruencies of the overall species-level phylogenetic tree with the phylogenetic trees for individual genes or genomic segments. If these incongruencies are not accounted for, it is possible to incur several biases in species tree estimation. Here, we present a simple maximum likelihood approach that accounts for ancestral variation and incomplete lineage sorting. We use a POlymorphisms-aware phylogenetic MOdel (PoMo) that we have recently shown to efficiently estimate mutation rates and fixation biases from within and between-species variation data. We extend this model to perform efficient estimation of species trees. We test the performance of PoMo in several different scenarios of incomplete lineage sorting using simulations and compare it with existing methods both in accuracy and computational speed. In contrast to other approaches, our model does not use coalescent theory but is allele frequency based. We show that PoMo is well suited for genome-wide species tree estimation and that on such data it is more accurate than previous approaches.}},

@article{Wiens1999,
	Abstract = { ▪ Abstract Polymorphism, or variation within species, is common in all kinds of data and is the major focus of research on microevolution. However, polymorphism is often ignored by those who study macroevolution: systematists and comparative evolutionary biologists. Polymorphism may have a profound impact on phylogeny reconstruction, species-delimitation, and studies of character evolution. A variety of methods are used to deal with polymorphism in phylogeny reconstruction, and many of these methods have been extremely controversial for more than 20 years. Recent research has attempted to address the accuracy of these methods (their ability to estimate the true phylogeny) and to resolve these issues, using computer simulation, congruence, and statistical analyses. These studies suggest three things: that (a) the exclusion of polymorphic characters (as is commonly done in morphological phylogenetics) is unjustified and may greatly decrease accuracy relative to analyses that include these characters; (b) methods that incorporate frequency information on polymorphic characters tend to perform best, and (c) distance and likelihood methods designed for polymorphic data may often outperform parsimony methods. Although rarely discussed, polymorphism may also have a major impact on comparative studies of character evolution, such as the reconstruction of ancestral character states. Finally, polymorphism is an important issue in the delimitation of species, although this area has been somewhat neglected methodologically. The integration of within-species variation and microevolutionary processes into studies of systematics and comparative evolutionary biology is another example of the benefits of exchange of ideas between the fields of population genetics and systematics. },

@article{Felsenstein1985,
	Abstract = {Inferring phylogenies from gene frequencies should be regarded as a statistical problem rather than treated in the framework of the hypothetico-deductive method. The approximations involved in a statistical treatment are discussed, as are the models of gene frequency change implicit in the use of statistical methods. In particular, the different genetic distance statistics have different assumptions. These are pointed out, and a Markov chain treatment of genetic drift in a small population is used to evaluate the behavior of a number of the most popular genetic distances. Distance measures that are standardized to correct for the effect of initial gene frequencies behave as expected, but only for moderate amounts of time and when initial gene frequencies are not extreme. The distance measures such as those by Balakrishnan and Sanghvi and by Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards, which are standardized for the effect of the initial gene frequencies, perform acceptably if the initial gene frequencies are not too extreme and the divergence time is not larger than twice the effective population size. A genetic distance based on discrete character coding of alleles according to their presence or absence shows quite unusual behavior. No genetic distance copes very well with extreme initial gene frequencies. The prospect of getting useable additional information from population samples of sequences is also discussed. Criticisms by J. S. Farris of an earlier paper that used statistical criteria to evaluate parsimony and compatibility methods are rebutted.},

Because of this mathematical difference, they were not clear about the relationship between their theories. In this paper, I make two points to clarify this relationship. First, I argue that Wright's theory concerns what I call ecological isolation by distance, whereas Mal{\'e}cot's concerns what I call genetic isolation by distance. Second, I suggest that if Wright's theory is interpreted appropriately, a previously unnoticed connection between the two theories emerges. },

	Abstract = {Variation within a species may be structured both geographically and by genetic background. We review the effects of such structuring on neutral variants, using a framework based on the coalescent process. Short-term effects of sex differences and age structure can be averaged out using fast timescale approximations, allowing a simple general treatment of effective population size and migration. We consider the effects of geographic structure on variation within and between local populations, first in general terms, and then for specific migration models. We discuss the close parallels between geographic structure and stable types of genetic structure caused by selection, including balancing selection and background selection. The effects of departures from stability, such as selective sweeps and population bottlenecks, are also described. Methods for distinguishing population history from the effects of ongoing gene flow are discussed. We relate the theoretical results to observed patterns of variation in natural populations.},

	Abstract = {This study tests alternative hypotheses regarding the underlying conditions favoring variation in degree of differentiation between cultures in an evolving lineage. To accomplish this we develop a phylogenetic analysis of the early Arctic Small Tool tradition (ASTt) of eastern Siberia and northern North America. The use of early ASTt data permits us to monitor change while largely eliminating the possibility of influence by other cultural traditions. It also allows us to explore lingering questions regarding ASTt migrations. We examine correlations between tree branch length as a measure of cultural differentiation and geographic distance (from the oldest site), mean radiocarbon date, and three measures of terrestrial ecological variation. Outcomes suggest that only geographic distance and radiocarbon dates correlate with tree branch length. We offer conclusions regarding ASTt evolution and migrations along with ideas for future research.},

	Abstract = {	The authors examine the cultural transmission of song among two species of  Darwin's finches (Geospiza fortis and G. scandens) on Daphne in the Galapagos islands.  In both species song is cultural inherited through the father, determined through principal component analsyses of father's song and maternal and paternal grandfather's song. The species sing the same songs throughout life, although there is random error in copying that leads to a minimal amount of variation in transmission, but the same number of song types have existed on the island for 20 years and no new variants have entered the population. The authors suggest that this means innovations come about from small copying errors and not entirely new structures.  There is also little effect from horizontal and oblique transmission (again, measured by performing regressions on principal components plots of sib versus sib, or males versus neighboring males.  
	Interestingly, females pair with males whose songs differ substantially from their fathers.  The Grants suggests that this is selection pressure against inbreeding.  Both species also recognize conspecifics by song.
	The Grants stugy cultural transmission in song in a way that is applicable to cultural transmission in humans.  They are able to determine the effect of nonparental transmission (minimal) empirically, thus getting around the problem of transmission models that archaeology has.
	The fact that females recognize and discriminate against some cultural variants is similar to the theory of information exchange in archaeology.  Although in archaeology there is little theoretical validation (at least discussed) for the adaptive benefits of advertising and recognizing group identity.  In the birds it prevents inbreeding, potentially in humans it increases cultural variation as well. How would this work in the American southwest?  Increased information exchange in the 1200-1400s increases cultural variability, a process that is selected because of increased environmental variation?},

	Abstract = {Authors examine the interrelationships of basketry variables among ethnographic collections from California. They seek to determine if basketry variation is influcence by geographic distance (partly a measure of ecology) or language affinity (partly, they say, a measure of cultural ancestry). This is known as Galton's problem (i.e., homology or analogy).   [Note however that the phylogenetic trees of linguists, upon which they compare their basketry data are not as robustly constructed as the trees of biologists--Gray and Jordan's study of Pacific languages is an exception]. They note of courese that there are problems with the various language trees for California (e.g., there appears to be a "wastebasket" stock that is a jumble of dissimilar languages--like "Non-Austronesian").  The authors use a simple set of potential variable to explain basketry similarity:  common ancestry (measured by language), geography, measured by distance, and, ecology measured by environmental zones. [this is simple than Lipo's system]

The first set of analyzes look at the similarity of basketry assemblages through phenetic comparisons using both Mantel Matrix tests and correspondance analysis.  The CA shows that geography accounts fo the most variation among assemblages, but this is a phenetic comparison.  This is essentially a Welsch et al comparison in that it does not separate possible homology and analogy [see Dunnel's comment on the Welsch et al./Romney CA aritcles].

For the phylogenetic analysis they first test for a phylogenetic signal in the data using a permuation tail probability (PTP) test.   This essentially compares a best-fit tree to the data to trees of the data after they have been randomized. If there is no difference between the real data tree and a tree of random data then there is little to no phylo signal. Then consistency index is used to see how well data fit the bifurcating tree model.

Kishino-Hasegawa tests compare different basketry trees to language, ecology, and distance trees to see if the basketry tree is similar to any of these (and thus explained by these variables).  [think about using Hunt/Geraghty's language data similarly for Fiji].  All of their so-called explanatory trees (e.g., language) are significantly different from the basket tree. There are no easily defined lineages in the california basket traditions, but there does seem to be three broad geographically defined groups.},

use marine sponges as foraging tools. We demonstrate that genetic
and ecological explanations for this behavior are inadequate;
thus, ``sponging'' classifies as the first case of an existing material
culture in a marine mammal species. Using mitochondrial DNA
analyses, we show that sponging shows an almost exclusive
vertical social transmission within a single matriline from mother
to female offspring. Moreover, significant genetic relatedness
among all adult spongers at the nuclear level indicates very recent
coancestry, suggesting that all spongers are descendents of one
recent ``Sponging Eve.'' Unlike in apes, tool use in this population
is almost exclusively limited to a single matriline that is part of a
large albeit open social network of frequently interacting individuals,
adding a new dimension to charting cultural phenomena
among animals.},

	Abstract = {	Longacre examines the distributions of decorative element on pottery at the Carter Ranch site and infers two or three residence groups each associated with their own Kiva and burial ground.  This was a landmark study (from Longacre's 1963 dissertation), one of the ceramic sociologists who began examining style differences at  small spatial scales compared with prior culture historical treatment.  This makes sense, as Binford was Longacre's advisor and in Longacre's work you can see culture as adaptive, participated in differentially, etc.
	The Carter Ranch site is located in east central Arizona and occupied from ca. AD 1100-1225. It was occupied during a time of increasing bad weather for farming and was probably inhabited by people co-existing to get along. There was also increasing population growth in this area.
	Longacre's analysis is based on pottery decoration, differentially distributed around room blocks.  The design element classification was produced by two artists and is certainly not paradigmatic or related in any hierarchical way (see for example Graves 1982).  Earlier analyses by Martin suggest that there are four different pottery types at the pueblo.  Longaces does a regression analysis and demonstrates that some of the design elements are differentially distributed across room floors, with a Northern roomblock group, a Southern roomblock group, and another group with only one excavated room. Analyses of design element distributions in fill tend to confirm these groups and suggest to Longacre that there was some temporal continuity in the residence groups.  These residence groups are composed of women marrying into the pueblo and learning ceramic decoration from the residence group.
	Analyses of the ceramics associated with the burials also tends to group them into two cemetaries associated with two of the residence groups and a third cemetary assumably used by all.
	Longacre concludes by saying that this research should stimulate further work on cultural process in archaeology.  He interprets the residence groups in terms of their adaptive significance in light of changing ecological and agricultural conditions at the time.
	Plog (1978) has summarized the criticisms of this research (as well as Hill's and Cronin's).  First, inferring interaction from ceramic decoration is fraught with difficulties (see Plog 1980):  Longacre does not take into account trade/exchange as a possible reason for ceramic diversity, differential decoration across vessel forms.  Analytically, the design classification is intuitive and the regression analysis uses inappropriate statistics.  Plogs reanalyis of the data using a more appropriate clustering algorithm does not support Longacre's residence groups (Longacres rooms of a residence cluster are spread out across the clusters of Plog's dendogram).  In terms of marriage rules, Longacre does not take into account variation in how pottery decoration is learned or the movement of people in various post-marital residence situations.
	Longacre's piece is exemplary of the New Archaeology's concern with explaining cultural processes using generalizations from ethnographic work.  Longacre also, like many New Archaeologists, used the same units as Culture Historians (ceramic design), but used at a small spatial instead of temporal scale, and interpretted them in terms of culture as an adaptive mechanism (residence groups are adaptive).  Here we see the same kinds of observations being explained by analogous processes (see Dunnell 1986).},

The idea of cultural traits and cultural transmission was much discussed in the literature. All early commentators, however, confused ideational and empirical units and thus had much confusion over definitional and scale issues. Anthropologists such as Kluckholm, Wissler, Spier, Linton, etc. all suggested that cultural traits were very complex thus making classificaiton difficult (because they were creating only extensional definitions).

Lyman and O'Brien suggest, building upon the work of Neff (1992), Skibo and Schiffer (1987), and Krause (1985), the idea of recipe as an ideational unit for cultural trait.  Recipes are used to create artifacts, the empirical units.  The authors relate the idea of recipe to meme as a cultural replicator.

Retouchlike edge damage, breakage, and other farms of macroscopic mechanical damage were observed on large numbers of pieces in all trampled sets. Experiments measured the relative contributions of three variables-raw material, artifact density, a,ld substrate-in generating damage. Results indicate that while all three factors contribute to some degree, substrate plays the most decisive role, and that artifacts are mure likely to exhibit damage if trampled on art impenetrable substrate. It was further found that trampling transforms flakes into pseudo-tools that can be classified as formal tools using a standard typology. Many of these are notched and denticulate pieces, indicating that special caution is needed in behavioral interpretations based on these tool types, and that the European Paleolithic Denticulate Mousterian industry requires critical reassessment.},

@article{8962,
	Abstract = {	Meltzer develops methods for examining what amount of stone tool variation is functional and what is stylistic.  He looks at the general category of endscrapers and produces a wear classification to group them as tools.  Both shaped "endscrapers" and utilized flakes that have the same form of wear are considered a single type of tool. He then compares, using discriminant function analysis, the overall morphologies of the tools (shape), both manufacture "endscrapers" and used flakes, and the kinds of wear (excessive or not).  He compares these variables across two assemblages:  one of tools from the Columbia river and another composite set of tools from Eastern North America and Northern Africa.  Meltzer hypothesizes that if the same tools in across each assemblage (defined by wear patterns) show no difference in morphology, then morphology is a functional characteristic. If it was not functional we would expect it to vary over such spatially (and temporally) distinct assemblages/environments.  Shape is functional.  Meltzer also examines the kind of wear (much, not much) and expects it to vary in a predictable manner based on kind of tool (manufacture/utilized flake).  If the kind of tool is functional then there should be no difference across wear patterns.  There is no difference thus kind of tool is also functional.  Thus there is no stylistic variability in this class of tools generally known as endscrapers.
	Meltzer's analysis, like Allen (1996), Beck (1998), and probably others, demonstrates that to analyze style and function you must first start out with distributions from which you develop expectations based on the model.  This underscores the fact that style and function are concepts related to distributions and not inherent in objects.  Thus the question, is painting your house blue, stylistic?  This is not a question that evolutionary archaeology can answer because it is not about populations (i.e., distributions).
	Meltzer's analysis is also related to the Mousterian debate of Binford and Bordes (see Sackett 1982 for a summary and another appraisal).
	1.  Introduction:
	Notes that style and function must be evaluated empirically in particular cases.
	2.  Style, Function, and Shape:
	Function is defined as the presence or absence of wear on an object and co-occuring wear classes across objects define tools (Dunnell 1978).  Wear is the only way you can measure the way an object interacts with the natural environment.  Argues against defining tools by their shape as many shapes can perform the same function.  Classes of tools (objects with similar wear patterns) can be manufactured and non-manufactured.  Tool classes that have a greater proportion of manufactured members should have a greater chance of exhibiting style.  
	3.  Methodological Considerations:
	Lays out the hypotheses if morphological patterning of tools is functional.  Specimens for analysis must not be biased by shape, must transform data into usable form, must have data from two different locales. [the distributional pattern argued above.].  
	4.   The Tests:
	Assemblages are from the Lower Columbia River, Eastern North America, and Northern Africa.  The tools are basically like endscrapers, distinguishes between greater and lesser wear.  Tools are grouped into one of four classes based on manufactured/non-manufactured and less wear/more wear.
	5.  Analyses:
	Discriminant analyis pulls out wear width and distal width as the primary variable contribution to the groupings.  The discriminant function back-classifies the tools with good accuracy. Where there is misclassification this is because tool morhpology is not important in deciding whether something is manufactured or nonmanufactured.  Wear patterns are also consistent across tool types.},

@article{8967,
	Abstract = {	The authors examine the place of engineering and perforamance characteristics in light of evolutionary explanations of the extended phenotype.  They emphasize the need to perform engineering analyses first and from these analyses determine the performance characteristics of different materials.  Their example is the spatio-temporal distribution of variously tempered ceramics (grog, sand, shell, limestone) across the Woodland and Mississippian periods in the Midwest.  Their analyses point to the complexities of determining the selective adavantage of different materials.  Explanations of why ceratain materials enjoyed a selective advantage must considers numerous factors including polymorphic trait distributions (i.e., one kind of temper didn't replace another kind, but varying frequencies of tempers existed across space-time), and the relationships between artifacts such as ceramics and other processes (e.g., subsistence and settlement patterns).  Performance analyses are a good place to start in the derivation of multiple hypotheses in the spirit of Hillborn and Mangel (1997).
	1.  Introduction:
	Evolutionary archaeology is largely untried but engineering analyses are the logical beginning point to examining human adaptedness and adaptation in terms of the extended phenotype.  They suggest that changes in technology are driven by selection for changes in performance characteristics.  
	2. Background:
	Discuss the essentialism/materialsim problem and the idea of transformations [e.g., considering shell-tempered pottery the beginning of the Missipian when other forms of pottery production persist].  
	They also discuss the concepts of adaptation and adaptedness and note three kinds of traits as discussed in O'Brien and Holland (1992). Adaptations increase adaptedness and are under selective control.  To explain them must examine origin of adaptations [models necessary to do this with knowledge of the selective environment--see comments in first paragraph.]  Engineering design analyses are important in two respects: (1) to see how artifacts were made and (2) to see how they performed.
	They also note that functionalist analyses are OK as long as they seek a detailed knowledge of the developmental history of a feature.  And in the history we must be focused on potential adaptedness not realized adaptedness [this is in tune with natural selection as a statistical argument].  
	They also discuss the extended phenotype [this is an essential concept if we are going to speak of artifacts as increasing human adaptedness.
	3.  Culture history:
	Late Archaic (ca. 3000-1000 BC), Early Woodland (ca. 1000-200 BC), Middle Woodland (ca. 200 BC - AD 400), Late Woodland (ca. AD 400-900), Mississippian (ca. post-AD 900).
	600 BC to AD 750 population rise and increased sedentary lifestyle.  groups becoming more agricultural.  Also, lots of exotics moved around and variation in treatment of the dead. Post AD 950 the area (American bottom) dominated by Cahokia and massive agricultural production of maize.  Both time periods [roughly Hopewell and Mississippian?] had marked social stratification, while the Hopewell had mounds and exotics, the Mississippian had fortified towns on mounds and agriculture.
	4. Design and performance analysis of Midwest pottery:
	Archaeological samples have gone through post depositional alterating that makes testing them directly an unreliable measure of prehistoric performance.  Rather, experimental work with test tiles is undertaken.  O'Brien et al. agree with Schiffer and Skibo(1987) that one must proceed analytically from the idea of performance characteristics.  Must distinguis this from an objects' technological characteristics. 
	5.  Late Archaic (3000-1000 BC) and Early Woodland (1000-200 BC) pottery:
	Earliest pottery at Nebo Hill (2600-1500 BC), soft, fiber tempered and others are grog tempered.  Thickness from 5mm-12mm. By 500 BC mineral tempered potteries more common over the midlatitude US east of Mississippi (e.g., Marion Thick).  Around 400 BC, and overlapping Marion Thick are new thinner, hard paste wares with large amounts of sand and crushed rock temper. 
	Schiffer and Skibo (1987) propose that this signitifes that archaic potters were into ease of manufacture and portability while, Woodland potters were into longer use-lives.  Temper likely plays a role here, but it is not a simple one.  What kind of pottery here is an adaptation?  Even though the thinner vessels appear they do not replace as thick mineral tempered vessels continue post AD 600.
	6.  MIddle Woodland (AD 200-400) and Late Woodland (AD 400-900) pottery:
	Braun's work here (west central Illinois) is important as he tracked temporal changes in vessel thickness.  The trend Braun docmuents begins with increasing wall thickness from 200BC - AD 50, then thickness steadily decreases with some variability in the rate of decrease.  O'Brien's (1987) analysis of contemporaneous pottery revealed a similar trend but with mean thicknesses greater than Braun's material. Woodland potters thus moved toward a thinner walled vessel that gave greater heat conductivity and thermal stress resistance while pre AD 50 potters were making pots of increasingly thick walls.  
	Braun also found that tempering characteristics changed through time.  Both the density of particles greater than 1mm and average particle size decreased.  These also indicate an increased move toward alleiviating thermal stress.  Changes in vessel diameter are also tracked.  Vessel diameter decreases from AD 50 to AD 350 then deceases.  At AD 350 Limestone temper becomes the predominant temper in O'Brien's Missouri ceramics.    This correlation does not explain however.  Two aspects of Limestone temper must be examined:  (1) Strength of finished product,and (2) performance during firing.  Preliminary analyses suggest that limestone is stronger than grit or grog when it is fired at 600C (this is because of effects of spalling and  preparation techniques)
	7.  Mississipian pottery (post AD 900):
	This is when shell-tempering comes on the scene, but it is not the replacement normally imagined [think about this in terms of the "Lapita replacement"].   Grog and sand sherds still produced several hundred years after arrival of shell.   O'Brien et al. ask what selective advantage, if any, did shell temper bring?  Seems there are two technologies for making shell tempered ceramics, coarse and fine shell temper.  Both have different performance characteristics and different intended uses [?].  Also early shell tempered pots were slipped and  this may have started out as a stylistic component, but likely took on functional signigicance.  
	8.  Discussion:
	Braun's plot of decreasing vessel thickness is a composite of different technologies.  It seems that different groups were responding in the same way to some selective pressure.  This pressure was likely tied to food production systems.  
	Also how is this trend tied to other components?  Sedentism (Braun says increased sedentism) and climatic fluctutations to explain the variability in the temporal rate in the decease of wall thickness. [but these components need to be related in a model--see Hillborn and Mangel (1997) on multiple hypotheses].  
	Adaptations and innovations? O'Brien et al. see the shift in vessel diameter and wall thickness (at ca. AD 300) as an innovation because it led to such abrupt changes in these two characteristics late in time. Also how is pottery technology related to the adaptedness of groups. Fertility rose in the late Woodland correlated with decreasing vessel wall thickness and better pots for cooking starchy foods and seeds. [how is this related to other components in terms of a model---think about Waste model as well].    In the same vein we must look at the adaptiveness of groups relative to one another [think about the different technologies of production here--also think about variation in Island Melanesian subsistence stratagies over the last 4.5kya.  Also need to examine the technological variation among these contemporaneous groups and their variable performance characteristics to begin making hypotheses about the relative adaptiveness of groups in different regions [do this for Island Melanesia and Lapita, but what does it mean to say one group is better adapted than another.  Will this help untangle history down the road, i.e. in examining the history of adaptations. I guess it would because if later all this variation is gone and you have only one winner, you'll want to see who the winner first went up against.  Thus starting with engineering analyses is good.  Finally, the extended phenotype applies to behaviors and artifacts, so what behaviors in the Pacific can be examined from an engineering standpoint?  Agriculture, voyaging?].},

Major causal factors are the artisan's knowledge and experience, extent of feedback on performance in activities along the artifact's behavioral chain, situational factors in behavioral chain activities, technological constraints, and social processes of conflict and negotiation. In identifying the causal factors at work in a specific case, the investigator must focus analytically on activities-that is, on people-people, people-artifact, and artifact-artifact interactions-and on the performance characteristics relevant to each. Application of this behavioral framework allows abandonment of many cherished but unhelpful concepts, including style and function. Ceramic artifacts, the low-fired, clay cooking pot in particular are employed for illustrative purposes.},

For archaeologists, these artifacts possess two salient properties: (1) they formed only part of a larger apparatus; but, (2) because perishables decompose, they ordinarily are the only part preserved. Consequently, the identity of that apparatus-i.e., whether dart or arrow-is not readily apparent. For various reasons, we may wish to know if stone bifaces functioned as dart or arrow points. Often we rely on reasonable assumptions, but Thomas's (1978) discriminant analysis is a more reliable way to distinguish the possibilities. This study extends Thomas's approach by increasing the dart sample and the rate of successful classification. Shoulder width is the most important discriminating variable. An independent test on a set of arrows also strengthens confidence in the results.},

@incollection{8946,
	Abstract = {	Teltser argues that frequency seriation as developed by culture historians has many incipient theoretical features that are later expanded by evolutionary archaeology.  Some of those incipient theoretical structures include the notion of similarity as a product of shared ideas (this cultural historians shared with early 20th century ethnologists, e.g., Wisler 1921).  Explained within an evolutionary framework, we can see that seriation works best on homologous traits, but that analogous traits also show similarities.  She argues that the methods of seriation required different frameworks than the interpretations of the results.  With its futher development by evolutionary archaeologists, seriation has a fundamental role in organizing archaeological variability into historical phylogenies, the evolutionary units in which change takes place.
	1.  Introduction:
	Goal is to understand the underpinnings of seriation with regard to culture history and evolutionary theory.  Seriation is fundamentally a product of dimensionally ordering (along the axis of time) and unti constuction.  Frequency seriation is important to evolutionary archaeology because it is based on formal similarity as phylogenetic relationships and it time as a continuous dimension.  To look at culture history's role we must differentiate between the structure and content of explanatory frameworks.  Culture hisotry's content was shared ideas and their structure was chopping up continuous variability into phases.
	2. Methodological Implications for the Scale of Evolutionary Change:
	Change is defined at the level of populations in evolutionary theory.  From this spawn debates about unit construction (e.g., Ford-Spaulding)
	3.  Seriation and Culture History:
	The early 20th century anthropologists were intersted in ethnic units to describe cultures. In archaeology we had the Midwestern Taxonomic Method (MTM; McKern 1939).  MTM was based on general (phenetic) similarity, so units had no necessary relation to space or time. The notion of culture as shared ideas was the rationale for the MTM.  Phases were defined with ethnic units although there were recognized problems.  Thus before ecological functionalism, ethnologists and archaeologists were pursuing similar goals.
	Frequency seriation begin in the Southwest and was later formalized by Ford (Phillips et al. 1951;  Ford 1962).  A second formalization occured with Cowgill (1972) and Dunnell (1970).  Here they set out strict rules for inferring chronology. Frequency seriation required a material strategy to unit construction, time as continuous, and change is frequency change. Thus the culture historians had a materialist methodology and an essentialist interpretive scheme.
	In practice the essentialist units were upheld and this can be partly seen inthe index fossil approach to dating.  Time became difference. 
	4.  Seriation and Evolutionary Theory:
	Aspects of evolutionary processes have much in common with the idea of culture as shared ideas, but evolutionary theory also explains analogous traits.  And explains the presence of both with a larger mechanism.  Teltser now goes into the recent developments of seriation as reflecting drift based on the work of Neiman (1990).
	5.  Conclusions:
	The fundamental use of seriation now is for phylogenies in evolutionary archaeology.  Also, this disciplinary history shows that when dealing with theory, new theory can incorporate old (like Newton and Einstein).},

@article{Ohtsuki:2006p6774,
	Abstract = {A fundamental aspect of all biological systems is cooperation. Cooperative interactions are required for many levels of biological organization ranging from single cells to groups of animals. Human society is based to a large extent on mechanisms that promote cooperation. It is well known that in unstructured populations, natural selection favours defectors over cooperators. There is much current interest, however, in studying evolutionary games in structured populations and on graphs. These efforts recognize the fact that who-meets-whom is not random, but determined by spatial relationships or social networks. Here we describe a surprisingly simple rule that is a good approximation for all graphs that we have analysed, including cycles, spatial lattices, random regular graphs, random graphs and scale-free networks: natural selection favours cooperation, if the benefit of the altruistic act, b, divided by the cost, c, exceeds the average number of neighbours, k, which means b/c > k. In this case, cooperation can evolve as a consequence of 'social viscosity' even in the absence of reputation effects or strategic complexity.},

	Abstract = {	Shapiro examines the theoretical study of style from an art historians point of view.  Interestingly, in several places, he characterizes the patterning of style as language, both in the sense of the art historian interpreting its meaning and the sense of the style attempting ot communicate something to observers [parrallel with style as signalling].  This is in an Anthropology volume done in 1953 and the article is aimed at both anthros and archys.  Thus it is interesting that an art historian speaks to us about style;  indicative of the colloquial treatment of style.  Also there is a parallel between the many different art history theories of style and archaeological theories of style.
	1.  Discusses style as a diagnostic marker for times and cultures.  Can use the progression of styles to infer chronology
	2. Style varies continuously and thus classifications miss the subtly involved in changing styles.   
	3.  The analysis of style is strongly influecned by western conceptions [this would be a word to the wise for those who see style as social signalling].  Stlye is analyzed in terms of symbols and iconography.  
	4.   NOtes that styles are defined by common qualities, but that there is a range of variation in a style.  And these differences within a style often belong to different historical strata and thus are much like elelments of a language.
	5. Discusses organic concept of style as one of growth and development.   Discusses a development from natural forms in art on up.  
	6.  Others theories of style attempt to explain changes in style in terms of cyclical developments [related to Kroeber 1919??].  Also notes that mechanical constraints of materials channel style.   And that components of a style can exist across several media [Lapita?].  Also, style is a means of communication (language) of the patterns of thought of a group.
	7.  There are theories of art that discuss racial or geographic characteristics of art.  
	8.  Finally, styles may reflects forms of social life, from egalitarian to marxism.},

@article{VictoriaHorner09122006,
	Abstract = {Observational studies of wild chimpanzees () have revealed population-specific differences in behavior, thought to represent cultural variation. Field studies have also reported behaviors indicative of cultural learning, such as close observation of adult skills by infants, and the use of similar foraging techniques within a population over many generations. Although experimental studies have shown that chimpanzees are able to learn complex behaviors by observation, it is unclear how closely these studies simulate the learning environment found in the wild. In the present study we have used a diffusion chain paradigm, whereby a behavior is passed from one individual to the next in a linear sequence in an attempt to simulate intergenerational transmission of a foraging skill. Using a powerful three-group, two-action methodology, we found that alternative methods used to obtain food from a foraging device (‚{\"A}{\'u}lift door‚{\"A}{\`u} versus ‚{\"A}{\'u}slide door‚{\"A}{\`u}) were accurately transmitted along two chains of six and five chimpanzees, respectively, such that the last chimpanzee in the chain used the same method as the original trained model. The fidelity of transmission within each chain is remarkable given that several individuals in the no-model control group were able to discover either method by individual exploration. A comparative study with human children revealed similar results. This study is the first to experimentally demonstrate the linear transmission of alternative foraging techniques by non-human primates. Our results show that chimpanzees have a capacity to sustain local traditions across multiple simulated generations.

	Abstract = {There is extensive evidence that adults, children, and some non-human species, represent routine events in the form of hierarchically structured &#039;action scripts,&#039; and show superior recall and imitation of information at relatively high-levels of this hierarchy. Here we investigate the hypothesis that a &#039;hierarchical bias&#039; operates in human cultural transmission, acting to impose a hierarchical structure onto descriptions of everyday events, and to increasingly describe those events in terms of higher hierarchical levels. Descriptions of three everyday events (going to a restaurant, getting up and going shopping) expressed entirely in terms of basic low-level actions were transmitted along ten chains each containing four adult human participants. It was found that the proportion of low-level information showed a significant linear decrease with transmission generation, while the proportions of medium- and high-level information showed significant linear increases, consistent with the operation of a hierarchical bias. The findings additionally provide support for script theory in general, and are discussed in relation to hierarchical imitation in non-human primates.},

@article{Guglielmino:1995,
	Abstract = {Cultural inheritance can be considered as a mechanism of adaptation made possible by communication, which has reached its greatest development in humans and can allow long-term conservation or rapid change of culturally transmissible traits depending on circumstances and needs. Conservativeness/flexibility is largely modulated by mechanisms of sociocultural transmission. An analysis was carried out by testing the fit of three models to 47 cultural traits (classified in six groups) in 277 African societies. Model A (demic diffusion) is conservation over generations, as shown by correlations of cultural traits with language, used as a measure of historical connection. Model B (environmental adaptation) is measured by correlation to the natural environment. Model C (cultural diffusion) is the spread to neighbors by social contact in an epidemic-like fashion and was tested by measuring the tightness of geographic clustering of the traits. Most traits examined, in particular those affecting family structure and kinship, showed great conservation over generations, as shown by the fit of model A. They are most probably transmitted by family members. This is in agreement with the theoretical demonstration that cultural transmission in the family (vertical) is the most conservative one. Some traits show environmental effects, indicating the importance of adaptation to physical environment. Only a few of the 47 traits showed tight geographic clustering indicating that their spread to nearest neighbors follows model C, as is usually the case for transmission among unrelated people (called horizontal transmission).

Transmission mechanisms responsible for their maintenance are worthy of theoretical and empirical inquiry; they are complex and each possible pathway has different effects on evolutionary stability of traits, as can be shown theoretically. A survey designed to evaluate the importance of some components of cultural transmission on a variety of traits showed that religion and politics are mostly determined in the family, a mode of transmission which guarantees high evolutionary stability and maintenance of high variation between and within groups.

	Abstract = {Let p(x,y) be the transition function for a symmetric irreducible recurrent Markov chain on a countable set S. Let ηt be the infinite particle system on S moving according to simple exclusion interaction with the one particle motion determined by p. Assume that p is such that any two particles moving independently on S will sooner or later meet. Then it is shown that every invariant measure for ηt is a convex combination of Bernoulli product measures μα on {0,1}s with density 0 ≥ α = μ ] η(x) = 1 ] ≤ 1. Ergodic theorems are proved concerning the convergence of the system to one of the μα.},

	Abstract = { Symmetry - invariance to certain operators - is a fundamental concept in many branches of physics. We propose ways to measure symmetric properties of vertices, and their surroundings, in networks. To be stable to the randomness inherent in many complex networks, we consider measures that are continuous rather than dichotomous. The main operator we suggest is permutations of the paths of a certain length leading out from a vertex. If these paths are more similar (in some sense) than expected, the vertex is a local center of symmetry in networks. We discuss different precise definitions based on this idea and give examples how different symmetry coefficients can be applied to protein interaction networks. },

	Abstract = {Observations of primate groups have shown that social learning can lead to the development of temporal stable traditions or even proto-culture. The social structure of primate groups is highly diverse and it has been proposed that differences in the group structure shall influence the patterns of social information transmission. While empirical studies have mainly focused on the psychological mechanisms of social learning in individuals, the phenomenon of information propagation within the group has received relatively little attention. This might be due to the fact that formal theories that allow actual testing have not been formulated, or were kept too simple, ignoring the social dynamics of multi-agent societies. We want to propose a network approach to social information transmission that (1) preserves the complexity of the social structure of primate groups and (2) allows direct application to empirical data. Results from simulation experiments with artificial group structures confirm that association patterns of group-members influence the expected speed of information transmission during the propagation process. Introducing a forgetting rate shows that under certain conditions the proportion of informed individuals will reach a stable rate in some systems while it will drop to zero in others. This suggests that the likelihood to observe temporal stable traditions shall differ between social systems with different structure.},

	Abstract = { Here we introduce a model in which individuals differ in the rate at which they seek new interactions with others, making rational decisions modeled as general symmetric two-player games. Once a link between two individuals has formed, the productivity of this link is evaluated. Links can be broken off at different rates. We provide analytic results for the limiting cases where linking dynamics is much faster than evolutionary dynamics and vice-versa, and show how the individual capacity of forming new links or severing inconvenient ones maps into the problem of strategy evolution in a well-mixed population under a different game. For intermediate ranges, we investigate numerically the detailed interplay determined by these two time-scales and show that the scope of validity of the analytical results extends to a much wider ratio of time scales than expected. },

@article{Kandler:2009p20739,
	Abstract = {In this paper we apply reaction-diffusion models to explore the relationship between the rate of behavioural innovation and the level of cultural diversity. We investigate how both independent invention and the modification and refinement of established innovations impact on cultural dynamics and diversity. Further, we analyse these relationships in the presence of biases in cultural learning and find that the introduction of new variants typically increases cultural diversity substantially in the short term, but may decrease long-term diversity. Independent invention generally supports higher levels of cultural diversity than refinement. Repeated patterns of innovation through refinement generate characteristic oscillating trends in diversity, with increasing trends towards greater average diversity observed for medium but not low innovation rates. Conformity weakens the relationship between innovation and diversity. The level of cultural diversity, and pattern of temporal dynamics, potentially provide clues as to the underlying process, which can be used to interpret empirical data.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary stability is a fundamental concept in evolutionary game theory. A strategy is called an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), if its monomorphic population rejects the invasion of any other mutant strategy. Recent studies have revealed that population structure can considerably affect evolutionary dynamics. Here we derive the conditions of evolutionary stability for games on graphs. We obtain analytical conditions for regular graphs of degree k > 2. Those theoretical predictions are compared with computer simulations for random regular graphs and for lattices. We study three different update rules: birth-death (BD), death-birth (DB), and imitation (IM) updating. Evolutionary stability on sparse graphs does not imply evolutionary stability in a well-mixed population, nor vice versa. We provide a geometrical interpretation of the ESS condition on graphs.},

In Section 1 it will be discussed in the light of recent progress in this field. The remaining Sections (2, 3, and 4) form an introduction to recent joint work with Thomas M. Liggett. They concern new types of systems where each component takes on a real value which fluctuates in a way depending linearly on the values of neighboring components. The ergodic theory for such systems with finitely many components is the subject of Section 2. The results suggest conjectures for the case of infinitely many components, stated in Section 3 and proved in the joint paper with T. Liggett (ibid.). Section 4 introduces another class of time evolutions whose ergodic behavior may be analyzed by similar methods.},

	Abstract = { We study fixation probabilities and times as a consequence of neutral genetic drift in subdivided populations, motivated by a model of the cultural evolutionary process of language change that is described by the same mathematics as the biological process. We focus on the growth of fixation times with the number of subpopulations, and variation of fixation probabilities and times with initial distributions of mutants. A general formula for the fixation probability for arbitrary initial condition is derived by extending a duality relation between forwards- and backwards-time properties of the model from a panmictic to a subdivided population. From this we obtain new formulae, formally exact in the limit of extremely weak migration, for the mean fixation time from an arbitrary initial condition for Wright's island model, presenting two cases as examples. For more general models of population subdivision, formulae are introduced for an arbitrary number of mutants that are randomly located, and a single mutant whose position is known. These formulae contain parameters that typically have to be obtained numerically, a procedure we follow for two contrasting clustered models. These data suggest that variation of fixation time with the initial condition is slight, but depends strongly on the nature of subdivision. In particular, we demonstrate conditions under which the fixation time remains finite even in the limit of an infinite number of demes. In many cases - except this last where fixation in a finite time is seen - the time to fixation is shown to be in precise agreement with predictions from formulae for the asymptotic effective population size. },

	Abstract = {We consider a system of denumerably many particles that are distributed at random according to a stationary distribution P on some closed subgroup X of Euclidean space. We assume that the expected number of particles in any compact set is finite. We investigate the relationship between P and the distribution Q of-particles as viewed from a particle selected "at random" from some set. The distribution Q is called the tagged particle distribution. We give formulas for computing P in terms of Q and Q in terms of P and show that, with the appropriate notion of convergences, Pn → P implies Qn → Q and vice versa. The particles are allowed to move in an appropriate translation invariant manner and we show that the tagged particle distribution Q' at a later time 1 is the same as the distribution of particles at time 1 as viewed from a particle selected "at random" from those initially in some set. We also show that Q' is the same as the distribution of particles at time 1 as viewed from a particle selected at random from those at the origin, when initially the particles are distributed according to Q. The one-dimensional case is treated in more detail. With appropriate topologies, we show that in this case there is a homeomorphism between the collection of stationary distributions P and tagged particle distributions Q. A stationary spacings distribution Q0 related to Q is introduced, and we show that with the appropriate topology the map taking Q to Q0 is a homeomorphism. Explicit expressions are found for all these maps and their inverses. The paper concludes by using the one-dimensional results to find stationary distributions for a class of motions of denumerably many unit intervals and to establish criteria for convergence to one of these distributions.},

	Abstract = {We examine bias in Markov models of diseases, including both chronic and infectious diseases. We consider two common types of Markov disease models: ones where disease progression changes by severity of disease, and ones where progression of disease changes in time or by age. We find sufficient conditions for bias to exist in models with aggregated transition probabilities when compared to models with state/time dependent transition probabilities. We also find that when aggregating data to compute transition probabilities, bias increases with the degree of data aggregation. We illustrate by examining bias in Markov models of Hepatitis C, Alzheimer's disease, and lung cancer using medical data and find that the bias is significant depending on the method used to aggregate the data. A key implication is that by not incorporating state/time dependent transition probabilities, studies that use Markov models of diseases may be significantly overestimating or underestimating disease progression. This could potentially result in incorrect recommendations from cost-effectiveness studies and incorrect disease burden forecasts.},

We find it is always harder for cooperators to evolve whenever the two graphs do not coincide. In the thermodynamic limit, the dynamics on both graphs is given by a replicator equation with a rescaled payoff matrix in a rescaled time. Analytical results are obtained in the pair approximation and for weak selection. Their validity is confirmed by computer simulations.},

@article{Dieckmann:2003p8105,
	Abstract = {We study the spatial adaptive dynamics of a continuous trait that measures individual investment in altruism. Our study is based on an ecological model of a spatially heterogeneous population from which we derive an appropriate measure of fitness. The analysis of this fitness measure uncovers three different selective processes controlling the evolution of altruism: the direct physiological cost, the indirect genetic benefits of cooperative interactions, and the indirect genetic costs of competition for space. In our model, habitat structure and a continuous life cycle makes the cost of competing for space with relatives negligible. Our study yields a classification of adaptive patterns of altruism according to the shape of the costs of altruism (with decelerating, linear, or accelerating dependence on the investment in altruism). The invasion of altruism occurs readily in species with accelerating costs, but large mutations are critical for altruism to evolve in selfish species with decelerating costs. Strict selfishness is maintained by natural selection only under very restricted conditions. In species with rapidly accelerating costs, adaptation leads to an evolutionarily stable rate of investment in altruism that decreases smoothly with the level of mobility. A rather different adaptive pattern emerges in species with slowly accelerating costs: high altruism evolves at low mobility, whereas a quasi-selfish state is promoted in more mobile species. The high adaptive level of altruism can be predicted solely from habitat connectedness and physiological parameters that characterize the pattern of cost. We also show that environmental changes that cause increased mobility in those highly altruistic species can beget selection-driven self-extinction, which may contribute to the rarity of social species.},

	Abstract = {In the traditional approach to evolutionary game theory, the individuals of a population meet each other at random, and they have no control over the frequency or duration of interactions. Here we remove these simplifying assumptions. We introduce a new model, where individuals differ in the rate at which they seek new interactions. Once a link between two individuals has formed, the productivity of this link is evaluated. Links can be broken off at different rates. In a limiting case, the linking dynamics introduces a simple transformation of the payoff matrix. We outline conditions for evolutionary stability. As a specific example, we study the interaction between cooperators and defectors. We find a simple relationship that characterizes those linking dynamics which allow natural selection to favour cooperation over defection.},

@article{Huia:2007p253,
	Abstract = {Because to defect is the evolutionary stable strategy in the prisoner's dilemma game (PDG), understanding the mechanism generating and maintaining cooperation in PDG, i.e. the paradox of cooperation, has intrinsic significance for understanding social altruism behaviors. Spatial structure serves as the key to this dilemma. Here, we build the model of spatial PDG under a metapopulation framework: the sub-populations of cooperators and defectors obey the rules in spatial PDG as well as the colonization-extinction process of metapopulations. Using the mean-field approximation and the pair approximation, we obtain the differential equations for the dynamics of occupancy and spatial correlation. Cellular automaton is also built to simulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of the spatial PDG in metapopulations. Join-count statistics are used to measure the spatial correlation as well as the spatial association of the metapopulation. Simulation results show that the distribution is self-organized and that it converges to a static boundary due to the boycotting of cooperators to defectors. Metapopulations can survive even when the colonization rate is lower than the extinction rate due to the compensation of cooperation rewards for extinction debt. With a change of parameters in the model, a metapopulation can consist of pure cooperators, pure defectors, or cooperator-defector coexistence. The necessary condition of cooperation evolution is the local colonization of a metapopulation. The spatial correlation between the cooperators tends to be weaker with the increase in the temptation to defect and the habitat connectivity; yet the spatial correlation between defectors becomes stronger. The relationship between spatial structure and the colonization rate is complicated, especially for cooperators. The metapopulation may undergo a temporary period of prosperity just before the extinction, even while the colonization rate is declining.},

	Abstract = { We study the evolutionary Prisoner's Dilemma on two social networks obtained from actual relational data. We find very different cooperation levels on each of them that can not be easily understood in terms of global statistical properties of both networks. We claim that the result can be understood at the mesoscopic scale, by studying the community structure of the networks. We explain the dependence of the cooperation level on the temptation parameter in terms of the internal structure of the communities and their interconnections. We then test our results on community-structured, specifically designed artificial networks, finding perfect agreement with the observations in the real networks. Our results support the conclusion that studies of evolutionary games on model networks and their interpretation in terms of global properties may not be sufficient to study specific, real social systems. In addition, the community perspective may be helpful to interpret the origin and behavior of existing networks as well as to design structures that show resilient cooperative behavior. },

The evolutionary outcome is often not a fitness-maximizing equilibrium but can include oscillations and chaos. For studying frequency-dependent selection, game-theoretic arguments are more appropriate than optimization algorithms. Replicator and adaptive dynamics describe short- and long-term evolution in phenotype space and have found applications ranging from animal behavior and ecology to speciation, macroevolution, and human language. Evolutionary game theory is an essential component of a mathematical and computational approach to biology.},

@article{Rousset:2006p320,
	Abstract = {To a first order of approximation, selection is frequency independent in a wide range of family structured models and in populations following an island model of dispersal, provided the number of families or demes is large and the population is haploid or diploid but allelic effects on phenotype are semidominant. This result underlies the way the evolutionary stability of traits is computed in games with continuous strategy sets. In this paper similar results are derived under isolation by distance. The first-order effect on expected change in allele frequency is given in terms of a measure of local genetic diversity, and of measures of genetic structure which are almost independent of allele frequency in the total population when the number of demes is large. Hence, when the number of demes increases the response to selection becomes of constant sign. This result holds because the relevant neutral measures of population structure converge to equilibrium at a rate faster than the rate of allele frequency changes in the total population. In the same conditions and in the absence of demographic fluctuations, the results also provide a simple way to compute the fixation probability of mutants affecting various ecological traits, such as sex ratio, dispersal, life-history, or cooperation, under isolation by distance. This result is illustrated and tested against simulations for mutants affecting the dispersal probability under a stepping-stone model.},

@article{Hauert:2006p290,
	Abstract = {The emergence and abundance of cooperation in nature poses a tenacious and challenging puzzle to evolutionary biology. Cooperative behaviour seems to contradict Darwinian evolution because altruistic individuals increase the fitness of other members of the population at a cost to themselves. Thus, in the absence of supporting mechanisms, cooperation should decrease and vanish, as predicted by classical models for cooperation in evolutionary game theory, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma and public goods games. Traditional approaches to studying the problem of cooperation assume constant population sizes and thus neglect the ecology of the interacting individuals. Here, we incorporate ecological dynamics into evolutionary games and reveal a new mechanism for maintaining cooperation. In public goods games, cooperation can gain a foothold if the population density depends on the average population payoff. Decreasing population densities, due to defection leading to small payoffs, results in smaller interaction group sizes in which cooperation can be favoured. This feedback between ecological dynamics and game dynamics can generate stable coexistence of cooperators and defectors in public goods games. However, this mechanism fails for pairwise Prisoner's Dilemma interactions and the population is driven to extinction. Our model represents natural extension of replicator dynamics to populations of varying densities.},

	Abstract = {We consider a SIR age-structured model with immigration of infectives in all epidemiological compartments; the population is assumed to be in demographic equilibrium between below-replacement fertility and immigration; the spread of the infection occurs through a general age-dependent kernel. We analyse the equations for steady states; because of immigration of infectives a steady state with a positive density of infectives always exists; however, a quasi-threshold theorem is proved, in the sense that, below the threshold, the density of infectives is close to 0, while it is away from 0, above the threshold; furthermore, conditions that guarantee uniqueness of steady states are obtained. Finally, we present some numerical examples, inspired by the Italian demographic situation, that illustrate the threshold-like behaviour, and other features of the stationary solutions and of the transient.},

@article{GomezGardenes:2008p14667,
	Abstract = {One of the current theoretical challenges to the explanatory powers of Evolutionary Theory is the understanding of the observed evolutionary survival of cooperative behavior when selfish actions provide higher fitness (reproductive success). In unstructured populations natural selection drives cooperation to extinction. However, when individuals are allowed to interact only with their neighbors, specified by a graph of social contacts, cooperation-promoting mechanisms (known as lattice reciprocity) offer to cooperation the opportunity of evolutionary survival. Recent numerical works on the evolution of Prisoner's Dilemma in complex network settings have revealed that graph heterogeneity dramatically enhances the lattice reciprocity. Here we show that in highly heterogeneous populations, under the graph analog of replicator dynamics, the fixation of a strategy in the whole population is in general an impossible event, for there is an asymptotic partition of the population in three subsets, two in which fixation of cooperation or defection has been reached and a third one which experiences cycles of invasion by the competing strategies. We show how the dynamical partition correlates with connectivity classes and characterize the temporal fluctuations of the fluctuating set, unveiling the mechanisms stabilizing cooperation in macroscopic scale-free structures.},

@article{Hauert:2004p373,
	Abstract = {Understanding the emergence of cooperation is a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology. Evolutionary game theory has become a powerful framework with which to investigate this problem. Two simple games have attracted most attention in theoretical and experimental studies: the Prisoner's Dilemma and the snowdrift game (also known as the hawk-dove or chicken game). In the Prisoner's Dilemma, the non-cooperative state is evolutionarily stable, which has inspired numerous investigations of suitable extensions that enable cooperative behaviour to persist. In particular, on the basis of spatial extensions of the Prisoner's Dilemma, it is widely accepted that spatial structure promotes the evolution of cooperation. Here we show that no such general predictions can be made for the effects of spatial structure in the snowdrift game. In unstructured snowdrift games, intermediate levels of cooperation persist. Unexpectedly, spatial structure reduces the proportion of cooperators for a wide range of parameters. In particular, spatial structure eliminates cooperation if the cost-to-benefit ratio of cooperation is high. Our results caution against the common belief that spatial structure is necessarily beneficial for cooperative behaviour.},

@article{Argasinski:2006p297,
	Abstract = {This paper contains the basic extensions of classical evolutionary games (multipopulation and density dependent models). It is shown that classical bimatrix approach is inconsistent with other approaches because it does not depend on proportion between populations. The main conclusion is that interspecific proportion parameter is important and must be considered in multipopulation models. The paper provides a synthesis of both extensions (a metasimplex concept) which solves the problem intrinsic in the bimatrix model. It allows us to model interactions among any number of subpopulations including density dependence effects. We prove that all modern approaches to evolutionary games are closely related. All evolutionary models (except classical bimatrix approaches) can be reduced to a single population general model by a simple change of variables. Differences between classic bimatrix evolutionary games and a new model which is dependent on interspecific proportion are shown by examples.},

@article{Hauert:2006p317,
	Abstract = {Social dilemmas and the evolutionary conundrum of cooperation are traditionally studied through various kinds of game theoretical models such as the prisoner's dilemma, public goods games, snowdrift games or by-product mutualism. All of them exemplify situations which are characterized by different degrees of conflicting interests between the individuals and the community. In groups of interacting individuals, cooperators produce a common good benefitting the entire group at some cost to themselves, whereas defectors attempt to exploit the resource by avoiding the costly contributions. Based on synergistic or discounted accumulation of cooperative benefits a unifying theoretical framework was recently introduced that encompasses all games that have traditionally been studied separately (Hauert, Michor, Nowak, Doebeli, 2005. Synergy and discounting of cooperation in social dilemmas. J. Theor. Biol., in press.). Within this framework we investigate the effects of spatial structure with limited local interactions on the evolutionary fate of cooperators and defectors. The quantitative effects of space turn out to be quite sensitive to the underlying microscopic update mechanisms but, more general, we demonstrate that in prisoner's dilemma type interactions spatial structure benefits cooperation-although the parameter range is quite limited-whereas in snowdrift type interactions spatial structure may be beneficial too, but often turns out to be detrimental to cooperation.},

	Abstract = {Cooperation is needed for evolution to construct new levels of organization. Genomes, cells, multicellular organisms, social insects, and human society are all based on cooperation. Cooperation means that selfish replicators forgo some of their reproductive potential to help one another. But natural selection implies competition and therefore opposes cooperation unless a specific mechanism is at work. Here I discuss five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation: kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity, and group selection. For each mechanism, a simple rule is derived that specifies whether natural selection can lead to cooperation.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary game theory has traditionally assumed that all individuals in a population interact with each other between reproduction events. We show that eliminating this restriction by explicitly considering the time scales of interaction and selection leads to dramatic changes in the outcome of evolution. Examples include the selection of the inefficient strategy in the Harmony and Stag-Hunt games, and the disappearance of the coexistence state in the Snowdrift game. Our results hold for any population size and in more general situations with additional factors influencing fitness.},

@article{Ohtsuki:2006p294,
	Abstract = {We study evolutionary games on graphs. Each player is represented by a vertex of the graph. The edges denote who meets whom. A player can use any one of n strategies. Players obtain a payoff from interaction with all their immediate neighbors. We consider three different update rules, called 'birth-death', 'death-birth' and 'imitation'. A fourth update rule, 'pairwise comparison', is shown to be equivalent to birth-death updating in our model. We use pair approximation to describe the evolutionary game dynamics on regular graphs of degree k. In the limit of weak selection, we can derive a differential equation which describes how the average frequency of each strategy on the graph changes over time. Remarkably, this equation is a replicator equation with a transformed payoff matrix. Therefore, moving a game from a well-mixed population (the complete graph) onto a regular graph simply results in a transformation of the payoff matrix. The new payoff matrix is the sum of the original payoff matrix plus another matrix, which describes the local competition of strategies. We discuss the application of our theory to four particular examples, the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Snow-Drift game, a coordination game and the Rock-Scissors-Paper game.},

@article{Ohtsuki:2006p295,
	Abstract = {A fundamental aspect of all biological systems is cooperation. Cooperative interactions are required for many levels of biological organization ranging from single cells to groups of animals. Human society is based to a large extent on mechanisms that promote cooperation. It is well known that in unstructured populations, natural selection favours defectors over cooperators. There is much current interest, however, in studying evolutionary games in structured populations and on graphs. These efforts recognize the fact that who-meets-whom is not random, but determined by spatial relationships or social networks. Here we describe a surprisingly simple rule that is a good approximation for all graphs that we have analysed, including cycles, spatial lattices, random regular graphs, random graphs and scale-free networks: natural selection favours cooperation, if the benefit of the altruistic act, b, divided by the cost, c, exceeds the average number of neighbours, k, which means b/c > k. In this case, cooperation can evolve as a consequence of 'social viscosity' even in the absence of reputation effects or strategic complexity.},

@article{Kendal:2009p20733,
	Abstract = {Humans and other animals do not use social learning indiscriminately, rather, natural selection has favoured the evolution of social learning rules that make selective use of social learning to acquire relevant information in a changing environment. We present a gene-culture coevolutionary analysis of a small selection of such rules (unbiased social learning, payoff-biased social learning and frequency-dependent biased social learning, including conformism and anti-conformism) in a population of asocial learners where the environment is subject to a constant probability of change to a novel state. We define conditions under which each rule evolves to a genetically polymorphic equilibrium. We find that payoff-biased social learning may evolve under high levels of environmental variation if the fitness benefit associated with the acquired behaviour is either high or low but not of intermediate value. In contrast, both conformist and anti-conformist biases can become fixed when environment variation is low, whereupon the mean fitness in the population is higher than for a population of asocial learners. Our examination of the population dynamics reveals stable limit cycles under conformist and anti-conformist biases and some highly complex dynamics including chaos. Anti-conformists can out-compete conformists when conditions favour a low equilibrium frequency of the learned behaviour. We conclude that evolution, punctuated by the repeated successful invasion of different social learning rules, should continuously favour a reduction in the equilibrium frequency of asocial learning, and propose that, among competing social learning rules, the dominant rule will be the one that can persist with the lowest frequency of asocial learning.},

	Abstract = {We study evolutionary dynamics in a population whose structure is given by two graphs: the interaction graph determines who plays with whom in an evolutionary game; the replacement graph specifies the geometry of evolutionary competition and updating. First, we calculate the fixation probabilities of frequency dependent selection between two strategies or phenotypes. We consider three different update mechanisms: birth-death, death-birth and imitation. Then, as a particular example, we explore the evolution of cooperation. Suppose the interaction graph is a regular graph of degree h, the replacement graph is a regular graph of degree g and the overlap between the two graphs is a regular graph of degree l. We show that cooperation is favored by natural selection if b/c>hg/l. Here, b and c denote the benefit and cost of the altruistic act. This result holds for death-birth updating, weak-selection and large population size. Note that the optimum population structure for cooperators is given by maximum overlap between the interaction and the replacement graph (g=h=l), which means that the two graphs are identical. We also prove that a modified replicator equation can describe how the expected values of the frequencies of an arbitrary number of strategies change on replacement and interaction graphs: the two graphs induce a transformation of the payoff matrix.},

	Abstract = { The spatial structure of populations is a key element in the understanding of the large scale spreading of epidemics. Motivated by the recent empirical evidence on the heterogeneous properties of transportation and commuting patterns among urban areas, we present a thorough analysis of the behavior of infectious diseases in metapopulation models characterized by heterogeneous connectivity and mobility patterns. We derive the basic reaction-diffusion equation describing the metapopulation system at the mechanistic level and derive an early stage dynamics approximation for the subpopulation invasion dynamics. The analytical description uses degree block variables that allows us to take into account arbitrary degree distribution of the metapopulation network. We show that along with the usual single population epidemic threshold the metapopulation network exhibits a global threshold for the subpopulation invasion. We find an explicit analytic expression for the invasion threshold that determines the minimum number of individuals traveling among subpopulations in order to have the infection of a macroscopic number of subpopulations. The invasion threshold is a function of factors such as the basic reproductive number, the infectious period and the mobility process and it is found to decrease for increasing network heterogeneity. We provide extensive mechanistic numerical Monte Carlo simulations that recover the analytical finding in a wide range of metapopulation network connectivity patterns. The results can be useful in the understanding of recent data driven computational approaches to disease spreading in large transportation networks and the effect of containment measures such as travel restrictions. },

	Abstract = {The puzzle of the emergence of cooperation between unrelated individuals is shared across diverse fields of behavioural sciences and economics. In this article we combine the public goods game originating in economics with evolutionary approaches traditionally used in biology. Instead of pairwise encounters, we consider the more complex case of groups of three interacting individuals. We show that territoriality is capable of promoting cooperative behaviour, as in the case of the Prisoner's Dilemma. Moreover, by adding punishment opportunities, the readiness to cooperate is greatly enhanced and asocial strategies can be largely suppressed. Finally, as soon as players carry a reputation for being willing or unwilling to punish, highly cooperative and fair outcomes are achieved. This group-beneficial result is obtained, intriguingly, by making individuals more likely to exploit their co-players if they can get away with it. Thus, less-cooperative individuals make more-cooperative societies.},

	Abstract = {The birth/death process with mutation describes the evolution of a population, and displays rich dynamics including clustering and fluctuations. We discuss an analytical 'field-theoretical' approach to the birth/death process, using a simple dimensional analysis argument to describe evolution as a 'super-Brownian motion' in the infinite population limit. The field theory technique provides corrections to this for large but finite population, and an exact description at arbitrary population size. This allows a characterisation of the difference between the evolution of a phenotype, for which strong local clustering is observed, and a genotype for which distributions are more dispersed. We describe the approach with sufficient detail for non-specialists.},

@article{Ohtsuki:2006p282,
	Abstract = {Traditional evolutionary game theory explores frequency-dependent selection in well-mixed populations without spatial or stochastic effects. But recently there has been much interest in studying the evolutionary game dynamics in spatial settings, on lattices and other graphs. Here, we present an analytic approach for the stochastic evolutionary game dynamics on the simplest possible graph, the cycle. For three different update rules, called 'birth-death' (BD), 'death-birth' (DB) and 'imitation' (IM), we derive exact conditions for natural selection to favour one strategy over another. As specific examples, we consider a coordination game and Prisoner's Dilemma. In the latter case, selection can favour cooperators over defectors for DB and IM updating. We also study the case where the replacement graph of evolutionary updating remains a cycle, but the interaction graph for playing the game is a complete graph. In this setting, all three update rules lead to identical conditions in the limit of weak selection, where we find the '1/3-law' of well-mixed populations.},

@article{Cressman:2004p352,
	Abstract = {In this article, we develop population game theory, a theory that combines the dynamics of animal behavior with population dynamics. In particular, we study interaction and distribution of two species in a two-patch environment assuming that individuals behave adaptively (i.e., they maximize Darwinian fitness). Either the two species are competing for resources or they are in a predator-prey relationship. Using some recent advances in evolutionary game theory, we extend the classical ideal free distribution (IFD) concept for single species to two interacting species. We study population dynamical consequences of two-species IFD by comparing two systems: one where individuals cannot migrate between habitats and one where migration is possible. For single species, predator-prey interactions, and competing species, we show that these two types of behavior lead to the same population equilibria and corresponding species spatial distributions, provided interspecific competition is patch independent. However, if differences between patches are such that competition is patch dependent, then our predictions strongly depend on whether animals can migrate or not. In particular, we show that when species are settled at their equilibrium population densities in both habitats in the environment where migration between habitats is blocked, then the corresponding species spatial distribution need not be an IFD. Thus, when species are given the opportunity to migrate, they will redistribute to reach an IFD (e.g., under which the two species can completely segregate), and this redistribution will also influence species population equilibrial densities. Alternatively, we also show that when two species are distributed according to the IFD, the corresponding population equilibrium can be unstable.},

@article{Almaas:2003p18562,
	Abstract = { Using both numerical simulations and scaling arguments, we study the behavior of a random walker on a one-dimensional small-world network. For the properties we study, we find that the random walk obeys a characteristic scaling form. These properties include the average number of distinct sites visited by the random walker, the mean-square displacement of the walker, and the distribution of first-return times. The scaling form has three characteristic time regimes. At short times, the walker does not see the small-world shortcuts and effectively probes an ordinary Euclidean network in {\$}d{\$}-dimensions. At intermediate times, the properties of the walker shows scaling behavior characteristic of an infinite small-world network. Finally, at long times, the finite size of the network becomes important, and many of the properties of the walker saturate. We propose general analytical forms for the scaling properties in all three regimes, and show that these analytical forms are consistent with our numerical simulations. },

	Abstract = {Networked structures arise in a wide array of different contexts such as technological and transportation infrastructures, social phenomena, and biological systems. These highly interconnected systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features, however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the underlying topological structure of the network. These results provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.

@article{Kandler20150905,
	Abstract = {Cultural change can be quantified by temporal changes in frequency of different cultural artefacts and it is a central question to identify what underlying cultural transmission processes could have caused the observed frequency changes. Observed changes, however, often describe the dynamics in samples of the population of artefacts, whereas transmission processes act on the whole population. Here we develop a modelling framework aimed at addressing this inference problem. To do so, we firstly generate population structures from which the observed sample could have been drawn randomly and then determine theoretical samples at a later time t2 produced under the assumption that changes in frequencies are caused by a specific transmission process. Thereby we also account for the potential effect of time-averaging processes in the generation of the observed sample. Subsequent statistical comparisons (e.g. using Bayesian inference) of the theoretical and observed samples at t2 can establish which processes could have produced the observed frequency data. In this way, we infer underlying transmission processes directly from available data without any equilibrium assumption. We apply this framework to a dataset describing pottery from settlements of some of the first farmers in Europe (the LBK culture) and conclude that the observed frequency dynamic of different types of decorated pottery is consistent with age-dependent selection, a preference for {\textquoteleft}young{\textquoteright} pottery types which is potentially indicative of fashion trends.},

	Abstract = {Gradient boosting machines are a family of powerful machine-learning
	techniques that have shown considerable success in a wide range of
	practical applications. They are highly customizable to the particular
	needs of the application, like being learned with respect to different
	loss functions. This article gives a tutorial introduction into the
	methodology of gradient boosting methods. A theoretical information
	is complemented with many descriptive examples and illustrations
	which cover all the stages of the gradient boosting model design.
	Considerations on handling the model complexity are discussed. A
	set of practical examples of gradient boosting applications are presented
	and comprehensively analyzed.},

	Abstract = { Using both numerical simulations and scaling arguments, we study
	the behavior of a random walker on a one-dimensional small-world
	network. For the properties we study, we find that the random walk
	obeys a characteristic scaling form. These properties include the
	average number of distinct sites visited by the random walker, the
	mean-square displacement of the walker, and the distribution of first-return
	times. The scaling form has three characteristic time regimes. At
	short times, the walker does not see the small-world shortcuts and
	effectively probes an ordinary Euclidean network in {\$}d{\$}-dimensions.
	At intermediate times, the properties of the walker shows scaling
	behavior characteristic of an infinite small-world network. Finally,
	at long times, the finite size of the network becomes important,
	and many of the properties of the walker saturate. We propose general
	analytical forms for the scaling properties in all three regimes,
	and show that these analytical forms are consistent with our numerical
	simulations. },

	Abstract = {This paper contains the basic extensions of classical evolutionary
	games (multipopulation and density dependent models). It is shown
	that classical bimatrix approach is inconsistent with other approaches
	because it does not depend on proportion between populations. The
	main conclusion is that interspecific proportion parameter is important
	and must be considered in multipopulation models. The paper provides
	a synthesis of both extensions (a metasimplex concept) which solves
	the problem intrinsic in the bimatrix model. It allows us to model
	interactions among any number of subpopulations including density
	dependence effects. We prove that all modern approaches to evolutionary
	games are closely related. All evolutionary models (except classical
	bimatrix approaches) can be reduced to a single population general
	model by a simple change of variables. Differences between classic
	bimatrix evolutionary games and a new model which is dependent on
	interspecific proportion are shown by examples.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a Markov chain approach that allows a rigorous
	analysis of agent based opinion dynamics as well as other related
	agent based models (ABM). By viewing the ABM dynamics as a micro
	description of the process, we show how the corresponding macro description
	is obtained by a projection construction. Then, well known conditions
	for lumpability make it possible to establish the cases where the
	macro model is still Markov. In this case we obtain a complete picture
	of the dynamics including the transient stage, the most interesting
	phase in applications. For such a purpose a crucial role is played
	by the type of probability distribution used to implement the stochastic
	part of the model which defines the updating rule and governs the
	dynamics. In addition, we show how restrictions in communication
	leading to the co-existence of different opinions follow from the
	emergence of new absorbing states. We describe our analysis in detail
	with some specific models of opinion dynamics. Generalizations concerning
	different opinion representations as well as opinion models with
	other interaction mechanisms are also discussed. We find that our
	method may be an attractive alternative to mean-field approaches
	and that this approach provides new perspectives on the modeling
	of opinion exchange dynamics, and more generally of other ABM.},

	Abstract = { We introduce a model of negotiation dynamics whose aim is that of
	mimicking the mechanisms leading to opinion and convention formation
	in a population of individuals. The negotiation process, as opposed
	to ``herding-like'' or ``bounded confidence'' driven processes, is
	based on a microscopic dynamics where memory and feedback play a
	central role. Our model displays a non-equilibrium phase transition
	from an absorbing state in which all agents reach a consensus to
	an active stationary state characterized either by polarization or
	fragmentation in clusters of agents with different opinions. We show
	the exystence of at least two different universality classes, one
	for the case with two possible opinions and one for the case with
	an unlimited number of opinions. The phase transition is studied
	analytically and numerically for various topologies of the agents'
	interaction network. In both cases the universality classes do not
	seem to depend on the specific interaction topology, the only relevant
	feature being the total number of different opinions ever present

@article{Barrat2004a,
	Abstract = {Networked structures arise in a wide array of different contexts such
	as technological and transportation infrastructures, social phenomena,
	and biological systems. These highly interconnected systems have
	recently been the focus of a great deal of attention that has uncovered
	and characterized their topological complexity. Along with a complex
	topological structure, real networks display a large heterogeneity
	in the capacity and intensity of the connections. These features,
	however, have mainly not been considered in past studies where links
	are usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or
	absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and the
	world-wide air-transportation network, which are representative examples
	of social and large infrastructure systems, respectively. In both
	cases it is possible to assign to each edge of the graph a weight
	proportional to the intensity or capacity of the connections among
	the various elements of the network. We define appropriate metrics
	combining weighted and topological observables that enable us to
	characterize the complex statistical properties and heterogeneity
	of the actual strength of edges and vertices. This information allows
	us to investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and
	the underlying topological structure of the network. These results
	provide a better description of the hierarchies and organizational
	principles at the basis of the architecture of weighted networks.},

@article{Blythe2006,
	Abstract = { We study fixation probabilities and times as a consequence of neutral
	genetic drift in subdivided populations, motivated by a model of
	the cultural evolutionary process of language change that is described
	by the same mathematics as the biological process. We focus on the
	growth of fixation times with the number of subpopulations, and variation
	of fixation probabilities and times with initial distributions of
	mutants. A general formula for the fixation probability for arbitrary
	initial condition is derived by extending a duality relation between
	forwards- and backwards-time properties of the model from a panmictic
	to a subdivided population. From this we obtain new formulae, formally
	exact in the limit of extremely weak migration, for the mean fixation
	time from an arbitrary initial condition for Wright's island model,
	presenting two cases as examples. For more general models of population
	subdivision, formulae are introduced for an arbitrary number of mutants
	that are randomly located, and a single mutant whose position is
	known. These formulae contain parameters that typically have to be
	obtained numerically, a procedure we follow for two contrasting clustered
	models. These data suggest that variation of fixation time with the
	initial condition is slight, but depends strongly on the nature of
	subdivision. In particular, we demonstrate conditions under which
	the fixation time remains finite even in the limit of an infinite
	number of demes. In many cases - except this last where fixation
	in a finite time is seen - the time to fixation is shown to be in
	precise agreement with predictions from formulae for the asymptotic
	effective population size. },

@article{Bonham2009,
	Abstract = {It has been suggested that, during the Pliocene (ca 5-1.8Ma), an El
	Ni{\~n}o state existed as a permanent rather than an intermittent
	feature; that is, the tropical Pacific Ocean was characterized by
	a much weaker east-west gradient than today. One line of inquiry
	used to investigate this idea relates modern El Ni{\~n}o teleconnections
	to Pliocene proxy data by comparing regional differences in precipitation
	and surface temperature with climate patterns associated with present-day
	El Ni{\~n}o events, assuming that agreement between Pliocene data
	and observations of modern El Ni{\~n}o events supports this interpretation.
	Here, we examine this assumption by comparing outputs from a suite
	of Mid-Pliocene climate simulations carried out with the UK Met Office
	climate model. Regional patterns of climate change associated with
	changes in model boundary conditions are compared with observed El
	Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation teleconnection patterns. Our results
	indicate that many of the proposed 'permanent El Ni{\~n}o' surface
	temperature and precipitation patterns are observable in Mid-Pliocene
	climate simulations even when they display variability in tropical
	Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) or when forced with a modern
	east-west SST gradient. Our experiments highlight the possibility
	that the same outcome may be achieved through different initial conditions
	(equifinality); an important consideration for reconstructed patterns
	of regional Mid-Pliocene climate.},

@article{Brandt2003,
	Abstract = {The puzzle of the emergence of cooperation between unrelated individuals
	is shared across diverse fields of behavioural sciences and economics.
	In this article we combine the public goods game originating in economics
	with evolutionary approaches traditionally used in biology. Instead
	of pairwise encounters, we consider the more complex case of groups
	of three interacting individuals. We show that territoriality is
	capable of promoting cooperative behaviour, as in the case of the
	Prisoner's Dilemma. Moreover, by adding punishment opportunities,
	the readiness to cooperate is greatly enhanced and asocial strategies
	can be largely suppressed. Finally, as soon as players carry a reputation
	for being willing or unwilling to punish, highly cooperative and
	fair outcomes are achieved. This group-beneficial result is obtained,
	intriguingly, by making individuals more likely to exploit their
	co-players if they can get away with it. Thus, less-cooperative individuals
	make more-cooperative societies.},

	culture requires key psychological processes (fundamentally imitation
	and teaching) that are absent or impoverished in non-human primates.
	In this paper we analyze the role that teaching has played in human
	cumulative cultural evolution. We assume that a system of cumulative
	culture generates increasingly adaptive behaviors, that are also
	more complex and difficult to imitate. Our thesis is that, as cultural
	traits become more complex, cumulative cultural transmission requires
	teaching to ensure accurate transmission from one generation to the
	next. In an increasingly complex cultural environment, we consider
	that individuals commit errors in imitation. We develop a model of
	cumulative cultural evolution in a changing environment and show
	that these errors hamper the process of cultural accumulation. We
	also show that a system of teaching between parents and offspring
	that increases the fidelity of imitation unblocks the accumulation
	and becomes adaptive whenever the gain in fitness compensates the
	cost of teaching. },

	Abstract = { The spatial structure of populations is a key element in the understanding
	of the large scale spreading of epidemics. Motivated by the recent
	empirical evidence on the heterogeneous properties of transportation
	and commuting patterns among urban areas, we present a thorough analysis
	of the behavior of infectious diseases in metapopulation models characterized
	by heterogeneous connectivity and mobility patterns. We derive the
	basic reaction-diffusion equation describing the metapopulation system
	at the mechanistic level and derive an early stage dynamics approximation
	for the subpopulation invasion dynamics. The analytical description
	uses degree block variables that allows us to take into account arbitrary
	degree distribution of the metapopulation network. We show that along
	with the usual single population epidemic threshold the metapopulation
	network exhibits a global threshold for the subpopulation invasion.
	We find an explicit analytic expression for the invasion threshold
	that determines the minimum number of individuals traveling among
	subpopulations in order to have the infection of a macroscopic number
	of subpopulations. The invasion threshold is a function of factors
	such as the basic reproductive number, the infectious period and
	the mobility process and it is found to decrease for increasing network
	heterogeneity. We provide extensive mechanistic numerical Monte Carlo
	simulations that recover the analytical finding in a wide range of
	metapopulation network connectivity patterns. The results can be
	useful in the understanding of recent data driven computational approaches
	to disease spreading in large transportation networks and the effect
	of containment measures such as travel restrictions. },

@article{Cressman2004,
	Abstract = {In this article, we develop population game theory, a theory that
	combines the dynamics of animal behavior with population dynamics.
	In particular, we study interaction and distribution of two species
	in a two-patch environment assuming that individuals behave adaptively
	(i.e., they maximize Darwinian fitness). Either the two species are
	competing for resources or they are in a predator-prey relationship.
	Using some recent advances in evolutionary game theory, we extend
	the classical ideal free distribution (IFD) concept for single species
	to two interacting species. We study population dynamical consequences
	of two-species IFD by comparing two systems: one where individuals
	cannot migrate between habitats and one where migration is possible.
	For single species, predator-prey interactions, and competing species,
	we show that these two types of behavior lead to the same population
	equilibria and corresponding species spatial distributions, provided
	interspecific competition is patch independent. However, if differences
	between patches are such that competition is patch dependent, then
	our predictions strongly depend on whether animals can migrate or
	not. In particular, we show that when species are settled at their
	equilibrium population densities in both habitats in the environment
	where migration between habitats is blocked, then the corresponding
	species spatial distribution need not be an IFD. Thus, when species
	are given the opportunity to migrate, they will redistribute to reach
	an IFD (e.g., under which the two species can completely segregate),
	and this redistribution will also influence species population equilibrial
	densities. Alternatively, we also show that when two species are
	distributed according to the IFD, the corresponding population equilibrium
	can be unstable.},

	classifiers include (1) very high classification accuracy; (2) a

	perform several types of statistical data analysis, including regression,

	Abstract = {We study the spatial adaptive dynamics of a continuous trait that
	measures individual investment in altruism. Our study is based on
	an ecological model of a spatially heterogeneous population from
	which we derive an appropriate measure of fitness. The analysis of
	this fitness measure uncovers three different selective processes
	controlling the evolution of altruism: the direct physiological cost,
	the indirect genetic benefits of cooperative interactions, and the
	indirect genetic costs of competition for space. In our model, habitat
	structure and a continuous life cycle makes the cost of competing
	for space with relatives negligible. Our study yields a classification
	of adaptive patterns of altruism according to the shape of the costs
	of altruism (with decelerating, linear, or accelerating dependence
	on the investment in altruism). The invasion of altruism occurs readily
	in species with accelerating costs, but large mutations are critical
	for altruism to evolve in selfish species with decelerating costs.
	Strict selfishness is maintained by natural selection only under
	very restricted conditions. In species with rapidly accelerating
	costs, adaptation leads to an evolutionarily stable rate of investment
	in altruism that decreases smoothly with the level of mobility. A
	rather different adaptive pattern emerges in species with slowly
	accelerating costs: high altruism evolves at low mobility, whereas
	a quasi-selfish state is promoted in more mobile species. The high
	adaptive level of altruism can be predicted solely from habitat connectedness
	and physiological parameters that characterize the pattern of cost.
	We also show that environmental changes that cause increased mobility
	in those highly altruistic species can beget selection-driven self-extinction,
	which may contribute to the rarity of social species.},

	Abstract = {Constructing a confidence interval for the actual, conditional error
	rate of a prediction rule from multivariate data is problematic because
	this error rate is not a population parameter in the traditional
	sense--it is a functional of the training set. When the training
	set changes, so does this "parameter." A valid method for constructing
	confidence intervals for the actual error rate had been previously
	developed by McLachlan. However, McLachlan's method cannot be applied
	in many cancer research settings because it requires the number of
	samples to be much larger than the number of dimensions (n > p),
	and it assumes that no dimension-reducing feature selection step
	is performed. Here, an alternative to McLachlan's method is presented
	that can be applied when p > n, with an additional adjustment in
	the presence of feature selection. Coverage probabilities of the
	new method are shown to be nominal or conservative over a wide range
	of scenarios. The new method is relatively simple to implement and
	not computationally burdensome.},

@article{Drummond2002,
	Abstract = {Molecular sequences obtained at different sampling times from populations
	of rapidly evolving pathogens and from ancient subfossil and fossil
	sources are increasingly available with modern sequencing technology.
	Here, we present a Bayesian statistical inference approach to the
	joint estimation of mutation rate and population size that incorporates
	the uncertainty in the genealogy of such temporally spaced sequences
	by using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration. The Kingman
	coalescent model is used to describe the time structure of the ancestral
	tree. We recover information about the unknown true ancestral coalescent
	tree, population size, and the overall mutation rate from temporally
	spaced data, that is, from nucleotide sequences gathered at different
	times, from different individuals, in an evolving haploid population.
	We briefly discuss the methodological implications and show what
	can be inferred, in various practically relevant states of prior
	knowledge. We develop extensions for exponentially growing population
	size and joint estimation of substitution model parameters. We illustrate
	some of the important features of this approach on a genealogy of
	HIV-1 envelope (env) partial sequences.},

@article{Estoup2003,
	Abstract = {The founding of new populations by small numbers of colonists has
	been considered a potentially important mechanism promoting evolutionary
	change in island populations. Colonizing species, such as members
	of the avian species complex Zosterops lateralis, have been used
	to support this idea. A large amount of background information on
	recent colonization history is available for one Zosterops subspecies,
	Z. lateralis lateralis, providing the opportunity to reconstruct
	the population dynamics of its colonization sequence. We used a Bayesian
	approach to combine historical and demographic information available
	on Z. l. lateralis with genotypic data from six microsatellite loci,
	and a rejection algorithm to make simultaneous inferences on the
	demographic parameters describing the recent colonization history
	of this subspecies in four southwest Pacific islands. Demographic
	models assuming mutation-drift equilibrium or a large number of founders
	were better supported than models assuming founder events for three
	of four recently colonized island populations. Posterior distributions
	of demographic parameters supported (i) a large stable effective
	population size of several thousands individuals with point estimates
	around 4000-5000; (ii) a founder event of very low intensity with
	a large effective number of founders around 150-200 individuals for
	each island in three of four islands, suggesting the colonization
	of those islands by one flock of large size or several flocks of
	average size; and (iii) a founder event of higher intensity on Norfolk
	Island with an effective number of founders around 20 individuals,
	suggesting colonization by a single flock of moderate size. Our inferences
	on demographic parameters, especially those on the number of founders,
	were relatively insensitive to the precise choice of prior distributions
	for microsatellite mutation processes and demographic parameters,
	suggesting that our analysis provides a robust description of the
	recent colonization history of the subspecies.},

	Abstract = {We examine bias in Markov models of diseases, including both chronic
	and infectious diseases. We consider two common types of Markov disease
	models: ones where disease progression changes by severity of disease,
	and ones where progression of disease changes in time or by age.
	We find sufficient conditions for bias to exist in models with aggregated
	transition probabilities when compared to models with state/time
	dependent transition probabilities. We also find that when aggregating
	data to compute transition probabilities, bias increases with the
	degree of data aggregation. We illustrate by examining bias in Markov
	models of Hepatitis C, Alzheimer's disease, and lung cancer using
	medical data and find that the bias is significant depending on the
	method used to aggregate the data. A key implication is that by not
	incorporating state/time dependent transition probabilities, studies
	that use Markov models of diseases may be significantly overestimating
	or underestimating disease progression. This could potentially result
	in incorrect recommendations from cost-effectiveness studies and
	incorrect disease burden forecasts.},

	Abstract = {We consider a SIR age-structured model with immigration of infectives
	in all epidemiological compartments; the population is assumed to
	be in demographic equilibrium between below-replacement fertility
	and immigration; the spread of the infection occurs through a general
	age-dependent kernel. We analyse the equations for steady states;
	because of immigration of infectives a steady state with a positive
	density of infectives always exists; however, a quasi-threshold theorem
	is proved, in the sense that, below the threshold, the density of
	infectives is close to 0, while it is away from 0, above the threshold;
	furthermore, conditions that guarantee uniqueness of steady states
	are obtained. Finally, we present some numerical examples, inspired
	by the Italian demographic situation, that illustrate the threshold-like
	behaviour, and other features of the stationary solutions and of
	the transient.},

@article{Gomez-Gardenes2008,
	Abstract = {One of the current theoretical challenges to the explanatory powers
	of Evolutionary Theory is the understanding of the observed evolutionary
	survival of cooperative behavior when selfish actions provide higher
	fitness (reproductive success). In unstructured populations natural
	selection drives cooperation to extinction. However, when individuals
	are allowed to interact only with their neighbors, specified by a
	graph of social contacts, cooperation-promoting mechanisms (known
	as lattice reciprocity) offer to cooperation the opportunity of evolutionary
	survival. Recent numerical works on the evolution of Prisoner's Dilemma
	in complex network settings have revealed that graph heterogeneity
	dramatically enhances the lattice reciprocity. Here we show that
	in highly heterogeneous populations, under the graph analog of replicator
	dynamics, the fixation of a strategy in the whole population is in
	general an impossible event, for there is an asymptotic partition
	of the population in three subsets, two in which fixation of cooperation
	or defection has been reached and a third one which experiences cycles
	of invasion by the competing strategies. We show how the dynamical
	partition correlates with connectivity classes and characterize the
	temporal fluctuations of the fluctuating set, unveiling the mechanisms
	stabilizing cooperation in macroscopic scale-free structures.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the dynamics toward cultural consensus in the Axelrod model
	on scale-free networks. By looking at the microscopic dynamics of
	the model, we are able to show how culture traits spread across different
	cultural features. We compare the diffusion at the level of cultural
	features to the growth of cultural consensus at the global level,
	finding important differences between these two processes. In particular,
	we show that even when most of the cultural features have reached
	macroscopic consensus, there are still no signals of globalization.
	Finally, we analyze the topology of consensus clusters both for global
	culture and at the feature level of representation.

	Abstract = {Cultural inheritance can be considered as a mechanism of adaptation
	made possible by communication, which has reached its greatest development
	in humans and can allow long-term conservation or rapid change of
	culturally transmissible traits depending on circumstances and needs.
	Conservativeness/flexibility is largely modulated by mechanisms of
	sociocultural transmission. An analysis was carried out by testing
	the fit of three models to 47 cultural traits (classified in six
	groups) in 277 African societies. Model A (demic diffusion) is conservation
	over generations, as shown by correlations of cultural traits with
	language, used as a measure of historical connection. Model B (environmental
	adaptation) is measured by correlation to the natural environment.
	Model C (cultural diffusion) is the spread to neighbors by social
	contact in an epidemic-like fashion and was tested by measuring the
	tightness of geographic clustering of the traits. Most traits examined,
	in particular those affecting family structure and kinship, showed
	great conservation over generations, as shown by the fit of model
	A. They are most probably transmitted by family members. This is
	in agreement with the theoretical demonstration that cultural transmission
	in the family (vertical) is the most conservative one. Some traits
	show environmental effects, indicating the importance of adaptation
	to physical environment. Only a few of the 47 traits showed tight
	geographic clustering indicating that their spread to nearest neighbors
	follows model C, as is usually the case for transmission among unrelated
	people (called horizontal transmission).},

	that allows the estimation of parameters under demographic models
	that are too complex to be handled by full-likelihood methods. We
	assess the utility of this method to estimate the parameters of range
	expansion in a two-dimensional stepping-stone model, using samples
	from either a single deme or multiple demes. A minor modification
	to the ABC procedure is introduced, which leads to an improvement
	in the accuracy of estimation. The method is then used to estimate
	the expansion time and migration rates for five natural common vole
	populations in Switzerland typed for a sex-linked marker and a nuclear
	marker. Estimates based on both markers suggest that expansion occurred
	<10,000 years ago, after the most recent glaciation, and that migration
	rates are strongly male biased.},

	traditionally studied through various kinds of game theoretical models

	resource by avoiding the costly contributions. Based on synergistic

	framework was recently introduced that encompasses all games that
	have traditionally been studied separately (Hauert, Michor, Nowak,
	Doebeli, 2005. Synergy and discounting of cooperation in social dilemmas.
	J. Theor. Biol., in press.). Within this framework we investigate
	the effects of spatial structure with limited local interactions
	on the evolutionary fate of cooperators and defectors. The quantitative
	effects of space turn out to be quite sensitive to the underlying
	microscopic update mechanisms but, more general, we demonstrate that
	in prisoner's dilemma type interactions spatial structure benefits
	cooperation-although the parameter range is quite limited-whereas
	in snowdrift type interactions spatial structure may be beneficial
	too, but often turns out to be detrimental to cooperation.},

@article{Hauert2004,
	Abstract = {Understanding the emergence of cooperation is a fundamental problem
	in evolutionary biology. Evolutionary game theory has become a powerful
	framework with which to investigate this problem. Two simple games
	have attracted most attention in theoretical and experimental studies:
	the Prisoner's Dilemma and the snowdrift game (also known as the
	hawk-dove or chicken game). In the Prisoner's Dilemma, the non-cooperative
	state is evolutionarily stable, which has inspired numerous investigations
	of suitable extensions that enable cooperative behaviour to persist.
	In particular, on the basis of spatial extensions of the Prisoner's
	Dilemma, it is widely accepted that spatial structure promotes the
	evolution of cooperation. Here we show that no such general predictions
	can be made for the effects of spatial structure in the snowdrift
	game. In unstructured snowdrift games, intermediate levels of cooperation
	persist. Unexpectedly, spatial structure reduces the proportion of
	cooperators for a wide range of parameters. In particular, spatial
	structure eliminates cooperation if the cost-to-benefit ratio of
	cooperation is high. Our results caution against the common belief
	that spatial structure is necessarily beneficial for cooperative
	behaviour.},

@article{Hauert2006a,
	Abstract = {The emergence and abundance of cooperation in nature poses a tenacious
	and challenging puzzle to evolutionary biology. Cooperative behaviour
	seems to contradict Darwinian evolution because altruistic individuals
	increase the fitness of other members of the population at a cost
	to themselves. Thus, in the absence of supporting mechanisms, cooperation
	should decrease and vanish, as predicted by classical models for
	cooperation in evolutionary game theory, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma
	and public goods games. Traditional approaches to studying the problem
	of cooperation assume constant population sizes and thus neglect
	the ecology of the interacting individuals. Here, we incorporate
	ecological dynamics into evolutionary games and reveal a new mechanism
	for maintaining cooperation. In public goods games, cooperation can
	gain a foothold if the population density depends on the average
	population payoff. Decreasing population densities, due to defection
	leading to small payoffs, results in smaller interaction group sizes
	in which cooperation can be favoured. This feedback between ecological
	dynamics and game dynamics can generate stable coexistence of cooperators
	and defectors in public goods games. However, this mechanism fails
	for pairwise Prisoner's Dilemma interactions and the population is
	driven to extinction. Our model represents natural extension of replicator
	dynamics to populations of varying densities.},

	Abstract = { Symmetry - invariance to certain operators - is a fundamental concept
	in many branches of physics. We propose ways to measure symmetric
	properties of vertices, and their surroundings, in networks. To be
	stable to the randomness inherent in many complex networks, we consider
	measures that are continuous rather than dichotomous. The main operator
	we suggest is permutations of the paths of a certain length leading
	out from a vertex. If these paths are more similar (in some sense)
	than expected, the vertex is a local center of symmetry in networks.
	We discuss different precise definitions based on this idea and give
	examples how different symmetry coefficients can be applied to protein
	interaction networks. },

	Abstract = {Observational studies of wild chimpanzees () have revealed population-specific
	differences in behavior, thought to represent cultural variation.
	Field studies have also reported behaviors indicative of cultural
	learning, such as close observation of adult skills by infants, and
	the use of similar foraging techniques within a population over many
	generations. Although experimental studies have shown that chimpanzees
	are able to learn complex behaviors by observation, it is unclear
	how closely these studies simulate the learning environment found
	in the wild. In the present study we have used a diffusion chain
	paradigm, whereby a behavior is passed from one individual to the
	next in a linear sequence in an attempt to simulate intergenerational
	transmission of a foraging skill. Using a powerful three-group, two-action
	methodology, we found that alternative methods used to obtain food
	from a foraging device (‚{\"A}{\'u}lift door‚{\"A}{\`u} versus
	‚{\"A}{\'u}slide door‚{\"A}{\`u}) were accurately transmitted
	along two chains of six and five chimpanzees, respectively, such
	that the last chimpanzee in the chain used the same method as the
	original trained model. The fidelity of transmission within each
	chain is remarkable given that several individuals in the no-model
	control group were able to discover either method by individual exploration.
	A comparative study with human children revealed similar results.
	This study is the first to experimentally demonstrate the linear
	transmission of alternative foraging techniques by non-human primates.
	Our results show that chimpanzees have a capacity to sustain local
	traditions across multiple simulated generations.},

@article{Huia2007,
	Abstract = {Because to defect is the evolutionary stable strategy in the prisoner's
	dilemma game (PDG), understanding the mechanism generating and maintaining
	cooperation in PDG, i.e. the paradox of cooperation, has intrinsic
	significance for understanding social altruism behaviors. Spatial
	structure serves as the key to this dilemma. Here, we build the model
	of spatial PDG under a metapopulation framework: the sub-populations
	of cooperators and defectors obey the rules in spatial PDG as well
	as the colonization-extinction process of metapopulations. Using
	the mean-field approximation and the pair approximation, we obtain
	the differential equations for the dynamics of occupancy and spatial
	correlation. Cellular automaton is also built to simulate the spatiotemporal
	dynamics of the spatial PDG in metapopulations. Join-count statistics
	are used to measure the spatial correlation as well as the spatial
	association of the metapopulation. Simulation results show that the
	distribution is self-organized and that it converges to a static
	boundary due to the boycotting of cooperators to defectors. Metapopulations
	can survive even when the colonization rate is lower than the extinction
	rate due to the compensation of cooperation rewards for extinction
	debt. With a change of parameters in the model, a metapopulation
	can consist of pure cooperators, pure defectors, or cooperator-defector
	coexistence. The necessary condition of cooperation evolution is
	the local colonization of a metapopulation. The spatial correlation
	between the cooperators tends to be weaker with the increase in the
	temptation to defect and the habitat connectivity; yet the spatial
	correlation between defectors becomes stronger. The relationship
	between spatial structure and the colonization rate is complicated,
	especially for cooperators. The metapopulation may undergo a temporary
	period of prosperity just before the extinction, even while the colonization
	rate is declining.},

@article{Jansson2013,
	Abstract = {Ethnocentrism refers to the tendency to behave differently towards
	strangers based only on whether they belong to the ingroup or the
	outgroup. It is a widespread phenomenon that can be triggered by
	arbitrary cues, but the origins of which is not clearly understood.
	In a recent simulation model by Hammond and Axelrod, an ingroup bias
	evolves in the prisoner's dilemma game. However, it will be argued
	here that the model does little to advance our understanding of ethnocentrism.
	The model assumes a spatial structure in which agents interact only
	with their immediate neighbourhood, populated mostly by clones, and
	the marker becomes an approximate cue of whether the partner is one.
	It will be shown that agents with an ingroup bias are successful
	compared to unconditional co-operators since they only exclude non-clones,
	but are outcompeted by less error-prone kin identifiers. Thus, the
	results of the simulations can be explained by a simple form of kin
	selection. These findings illustrate how spatial assumptions can
	alter a model to the extent that it no longer describes the phenomenon
	under study.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we apply reaction-diffusion models to explore the relationship
	between the rate of behavioural innovation and the level of cultural
	diversity. We investigate how both independent invention and the
	modification and refinement of established innovations impact on
	cultural dynamics and diversity. Further, we analyse these relationships
	in the presence of biases in cultural learning and find that the
	introduction of new variants typically increases cultural diversity
	substantially in the short term, but may decrease long-term diversity.
	Independent invention generally supports higher levels of cultural
	diversity than refinement. Repeated patterns of innovation through
	refinement generate characteristic oscillating trends in diversity,
	with increasing trends towards greater average diversity observed
	for medium but not low innovation rates. Conformity weakens the relationship
	between innovation and diversity. The level of cultural diversity,
	and pattern of temporal dynamics, potentially provide clues as to
	the underlying process, which can be used to interpret empirical
	data.},

@article{Kendal2009,
	Abstract = {Humans and other animals do not use social learning indiscriminately,
	rather, natural selection has favoured the evolution of social learning
	rules that make selective use of social learning to acquire relevant
	information in a changing environment. We present a gene-culture
	coevolutionary analysis of a small selection of such rules (unbiased
	social learning, payoff-biased social learning and frequency-dependent
	biased social learning, including conformism and anti-conformism)
	in a population of asocial learners where the environment is subject
	to a constant probability of change to a novel state. We define conditions
	under which each rule evolves to a genetically polymorphic equilibrium.
	We find that payoff-biased social learning may evolve under high
	levels of environmental variation if the fitness benefit associated
	with the acquired behaviour is either high or low but not of intermediate
	value. In contrast, both conformist and anti-conformist biases can
	become fixed when environment variation is low, whereupon the mean
	fitness in the population is higher than for a population of asocial
	learners. Our examination of the population dynamics reveals stable
	limit cycles under conformist and anti-conformist biases and some
	highly complex dynamics including chaos. Anti-conformists can out-compete
	conformists when conditions favour a low equilibrium frequency of
	the learned behaviour. We conclude that evolution, punctuated by
	the repeated successful invasion of different social learning rules,
	should continuously favour a reduction in the equilibrium frequency
	of asocial learning, and propose that, among competing social learning
	rules, the dominant rule will be the one that can persist with the
	lowest frequency of asocial learning.},

	Abstract = {The birth/death process with mutation describes the evolution of a

	We discuss an analytical 'field-theoretical' approach to the birth/death
	process, using a simple dimensional analysis argument to describe
	evolution as a 'super-Brownian motion' in the infinite population
	limit. The field theory technique provides corrections to this for
	large but finite population, and an exact description at arbitrary
	population size. This allows a characterisation of the difference
	between the evolution of a phenotype, for which strong local clustering
	is observed, and a genotype for which distributions are more dispersed.
	We describe the approach with sufficient detail for non-specialists.},

@article{Lipo2015,
	Abstract = {<p>Frequency seriation played a key role in the formation of archaeology
	as a discipline due to its ability to generate chronologies. Interest
	in its utility for exploring issues of contemporary interest beyond
	chronology, however, has been limited. This limitation is partly
	due to a lack of quantitative algorithms that can be used to build
	deterministic seriation solutions. When the number of assemblages
	becomes greater than just a handful, the resources required for evaluation
	of possible permutations easily outstrips available computing capacity.
	On the other hand, probabilistic approaches to creating seriations
	offer a computationally manageable alternative but rely upon a compressed
	description of the data to order assemblages. This compression removes
	the ability to use all of the features of our data to fit to the
	seriation model, obscuring violations of the model, and thus lessens
	our ability to understand the degree to which the resulting order
	is chronological, spatial, or a mixture. Recently, frequency seriation
	has been reconceived as a general method for studying the structure
	of cultural transmission through time and across space. The use of
	an evolution-based framework renews the potential for seriation but
	also calls for a computationally feasible algorithm that is capable
	of producing solutions under varying configurations, without manual
	trial and error fitting. Here, we introduce the Iterative Deterministic
	Seriation Solution (IDSS) for constructing frequency seriations,
	an algorithm that dramatically constrains the search for potential
	valid orders of assemblages. Our initial implementation of IDSS does
	not solve all the problems of seriation, but begins to moves towards
	a resolution of a long-standing problem in archaeology while opening
	up new avenues of research into the study of cultural relatedness.
	We demonstrate the utility of IDSS using late prehistoric decorated
	ceramics from the Mississippi River Valley. The results compare favorably
	to previous analyses but add new details into the structure of cultural
	transmission of these late prehistoric populations.</p>},

	Abstract = { We study the evolutionary Prisoner's Dilemma on two social networks
	obtained from actual relational data. We find very different cooperation
	levels on each of them that can not be easily understood in terms
	of global statistical properties of both networks. We claim that
	the result can be understood at the mesoscopic scale, by studying
	the community structure of the networks. We explain the dependence
	of the cooperation level on the temptation parameter in terms of
	the internal structure of the communities and their interconnections.
	We then test our results on community-structured, specifically designed
	artificial networks, finding perfect agreement with the observations
	in the real networks. Our results support the conclusion that studies
	of evolutionary games on model networks and their interpretation
	in terms of global properties may not be sufficient to study specific,
	real social systems. In addition, the community perspective may be
	helpful to interpret the origin and behavior of existing networks
	as well as to design structures that show resilient cooperative behavior.

	Abstract = {There is extensive evidence that adults, children, and some non-human
	species, represent routine events in the form of hierarchically structured
	&#039;action scripts,&#039; and show superior recall and imitation
	of information at relatively high-levels of this hierarchy. Here
	we investigate the hypothesis that a &#039;hierarchical bias&#039;
	operates in human cultural transmission, acting to impose a hierarchical
	structure onto descriptions of everyday events, and to increasingly
	describe those events in terms of higher hierarchical levels. Descriptions
	of three everyday events (going to a restaurant, getting up and going
	shopping) expressed entirely in terms of basic low-level actions
	were transmitted along ten chains each containing four adult human
	participants. It was found that the proportion of low-level information
	showed a significant linear decrease with transmission generation,
	while the proportions of medium- and high-level information showed
	significant linear increases, consistent with the operation of a
	hierarchical bias. The findings additionally provide support for
	script theory in general, and are discussed in relation to hierarchical
	imitation in non-human primates.},

	Abstract = {Cooperation is needed for evolution to construct new levels of organization.
	Genomes, cells, multicellular organisms, social insects, and human
	society are all based on cooperation. Cooperation means that selfish
	replicators forgo some of their reproductive potential to help one
	another. But natural selection implies competition and therefore
	opposes cooperation unless a specific mechanism is at work. Here
	I discuss five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation: kin selection,
	direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity, and
	group selection. For each mechanism, a simple rule is derived that
	specifies whether natural selection can lead to cooperation.},

	Abstract = {Darwinian dynamics based on mutation and selection form the core of
	mathematical models for adaptation and coevolution of biological
	populations. The evolutionary outcome is often not a fitness-maximizing
	equilibrium but can include oscillations and chaos. For studying
	frequency-dependent selection, game-theoretic arguments are more
	appropriate than optimization algorithms. Replicator and adaptive
	dynamics describe short- and long-term evolution in phenotype space
	and have found applications ranging from animal behavior and ecology
	to speciation, macroevolution, and human language. Evolutionary game
	theory is an essential component of a mathematical and computational
	approach to biology.},

	Abstract = {We study evolutionary games on graphs. Each player is represented
	by a vertex of the graph. The edges denote who meets whom. A player
	can use any one of n strategies. Players obtain a payoff from interaction
	with all their immediate neighbors. We consider three different update
	rules, called 'birth-death', 'death-birth' and 'imitation'. A fourth
	update rule, 'pairwise comparison', is shown to be equivalent to
	birth-death updating in our model. We use pair approximation to describe
	the evolutionary game dynamics on regular graphs of degree k. In
	the limit of weak selection, we can derive a differential equation
	which describes how the average frequency of each strategy on the
	graph changes over time. Remarkably, this equation is a replicator
	equation with a transformed payoff matrix. Therefore, moving a game
	from a well-mixed population (the complete graph) onto a regular
	graph simply results in a transformation of the payoff matrix. The
	new payoff matrix is the sum of the original payoff matrix plus another
	matrix, which describes the local competition of strategies. We discuss
	the application of our theory to four particular examples, the Prisoner's
	Dilemma, the Snow-Drift game, a coordination game and the Rock-Scissors-Paper
	game.},

	selection in well-mixed populations without spatial or stochastic
	effects. But recently there has been much interest in studying the
	evolutionary game dynamics in spatial settings, on lattices and other
	graphs. Here, we present an analytic approach for the stochastic
	evolutionary game dynamics on the simplest possible graph, the cycle.
	For three different update rules, called 'birth-death' (BD), 'death-birth'
	(DB) and 'imitation' (IM), we derive exact conditions for natural
	selection to favour one strategy over another. As specific examples,
	we consider a coordination game and Prisoner's Dilemma. In the latter
	case, selection can favour cooperators over defectors for DB and
	IM updating. We also study the case where the replacement graph of
	evolutionary updating remains a cycle, but the interaction graph
	for playing the game is a complete graph. In this setting, all three
	update rules lead to identical conditions in the limit of weak selection,
	where we find the '1/3-law' of well-mixed populations.},

	Abstract = {We study evolutionary dynamics in a population whose structure is
	given by two graphs: the interaction graph determines who plays with
	whom in an evolutionary game; the replacement graph specifies the
	geometry of evolutionary competition and updating. First, we calculate
	the fixation probabilities of frequency dependent selection between
	two strategies or phenotypes. We consider three different update
	mechanisms: birth-death, death-birth and imitation. Then, as a particular
	example, we explore the evolution of cooperation. Suppose the interaction
	graph is a regular graph of degree h, the replacement graph is a
	regular graph of degree g and the overlap between the two graphs
	is a regular graph of degree l. We show that cooperation is favored
	by natural selection if b/c>hg/l. Here, b and c denote the benefit
	and cost of the altruistic act. This result holds for death-birth
	updating, weak-selection and large population size. Note that the
	optimum population structure for cooperators is given by maximum
	overlap between the interaction and the replacement graph (g=h=l),
	which means that the two graphs are identical. We also prove that
	a modified replicator equation can describe how the expected values

	Abstract = {In the traditional approach to evolutionary game theory, the individuals
	of a population meet each other at random, and they have no control
	over the frequency or duration of interactions. Here we remove these
	simplifying assumptions. We introduce a new model, where individuals
	differ in the rate at which they seek new interactions. Once a link
	between two individuals has formed, the productivity of this link
	is evaluated. Links can be broken off at different rates. In a limiting
	case, the linking dynamics introduces a simple transformation of
	the payoff matrix. We outline conditions for evolutionary stability.
	As a specific example, we study the interaction between cooperators
	and defectors. We find a simple relationship that characterizes those
	linking dynamics which allow natural selection to favour cooperation
	over defection.},

	Abstract = { Here we introduce a model in which individuals differ in the rate
	at which they seek new interactions with others, making rational
	decisions modeled as general symmetric two-player games. Once a link
	between two individuals has formed, the productivity of this link
	is evaluated. Links can be broken off at different rates. We provide
	analytic results for the limiting cases where linking dynamics is
	much faster than evolutionary dynamics and vice-versa, and show how
	the individual capacity of forming new links or severing inconvenient
	ones maps into the problem of strategy evolution in a well-mixed
	population under a different game. For intermediate ranges, we investigate
	numerically the detailed interplay determined by these two time-scales
	and show that the scope of validity of the analytical results extends
	to a much wider ratio of time scales than expected. },

@article{Port1973,
	Abstract = {We consider a system of denumerably many particles that are distributed
	at random according to a stationary distribution P on some closed
	subgroup X of Euclidean space. We assume that the expected number
	of particles in any compact set is finite. We investigate the relationship
	between P and the distribution Q of-particles as viewed from a particle
	selected "at random" from some set. The distribution Q is called
	the tagged particle distribution. We give formulas for computing
	P in terms of Q and Q in terms of P and show that, with the appropriate
	notion of convergences, Pn → P implies Qn → Q and vice versa.
	The particles are allowed to move in an appropriate translation invariant
	manner and we show that the tagged particle distribution Q' at a
	later time 1 is the same as the distribution of particles at time
	1 as viewed from a particle selected "at random" from those initially
	in some set. We also show that Q' is the same as the distribution
	of particles at time 1 as viewed from a particle selected at random
	from those at the origin, when initially the particles are distributed
	according to Q. The one-dimensional case is treated in more detail.
	With appropriate topologies, we show that in this case there is a
	homeomorphism between the collection of stationary distributions
	P and tagged particle distributions Q. A stationary spacings distribution
	Q0 related to Q is introduced, and we show that with the appropriate
	topology the map taking Q to Q0 is a homeomorphism. Explicit expressions
	are found for all these maps and their inverses. The paper concludes
	by using the one-dimensional results to find stationary distributions
	for a class of motions of denumerably many unit intervals and to
	establish criteria for convergence to one of these distributions.},

	Abstract = {Anthropologists have adopted methods from population genetics to study
	modes of cultural transmission in time-transgressive cultural data
	sets. However, it remains unclear to what extent methods originally
	developed to assess neutrality in genes sampled from a population
	at a single point in time are applicable to cultural variants sampled
	from assemblages. This report applies a suite of previously published
	methods to assemblages formed under unbiased cultural transmission.
	The results show that, even under the controlled conditions afforded
	by computer simulation, all but one method (the variants frequency
	approach) fail to identify unbiased cultural transmission in samples
	collected from moderately to severely time-averaged assemblages.
	While it is encouraging that the method that is best at identifying
	unbiased cultural transmission in simulated time-averaged data also
	is relatively robust to relative sample size, additional work is
	needed to determine whether even the variants frequency approach

	Abstract = {We use variation at a set of eight human Y chromosome microsatellite
	loci to investigate the demographic history of the Y chromosome.
	Instead of assuming a population of constant size, as in most of
	the previous work on the Y chromosome, we consider a model which
	permits a period of recent population growth. We show that for most
	of the populations in our sample this model fits the data far better
	than a model with no growth. We estimate the demographic parameters
	of this model for each population and also the time to the most recent
	common ancestor. Since there is some uncertainty about the details
	of the microsatellite mutation process, we consider several plausible
	mutation schemes and estimate the variance in mutation size simultaneously
	with the demographic parameters of interest. Our finding of a recent
	common ancestor (probably in the last 120,000 years), coupled with
	a strong signal of demographic expansion in all populations, suggests
	either a recent human expansion from a small ancestral population,
	or natural selection acting on the Y chromosome.},

	Abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) have become an essential tool
	for the analysis of complex stochastic models. Grelaud et al. [(2009)
	Bayesian Anal 3:427-442] advocated the use of ABC for model choice
	in the specific case of Gibbs random fields, relying on an intermodel
	sufficiency property to show that the approximation was legitimate.
	We implemented ABC model choice in a wide range of phylogenetic models
	in the Do It Yourself-ABC (DIY-ABC) software [Cornuet et al. (2008)
	Bioinformatics 24:2713-2719]. We now present arguments as to why
	the theoretical arguments for ABC model choice are missing, because
	the algorithm involves an unknown loss of information induced by
	the use of insufficient summary statistics. The approximation error
	of the posterior probabilities of the models under comparison may
	thus be unrelated with the computational effort spent in running
	an ABC algorithm. We then conclude that additional empirical verifications
	of the performances of the ABC procedure as those available in DIY-ABC
	are necessary to conduct model choice.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary game theory has traditionally assumed that all individuals
	in a population interact with each other between reproduction events.
	We show that eliminating this restriction by explicitly considering
	the time scales of interaction and selection leads to dramatic changes
	in the outcome of evolution. Examples include the selection of the
	inefficient strategy in the Harmony and Stag-Hunt games, and the
	disappearance of the coexistence state in the Snowdrift game. Our
	results hold for any population size and in more general situations
	with additional factors influencing fitness.},

@article{Rogers2000,
	Abstract = {A faunal assemblage may be dominated by dense bones either because
	the soft ones have been transported away or because they have been
	gnawed beyond recognition. Archaeologists have often despaired of
	distinguishing between these hypotheses and have attributed the problem
	to equifinality-to the fact that different causes can produce identical
	outcomes. Yet under the models of transport and attrition studied
	here, these causes do not produce identical outcomes. It has been
	difficult to distinguish between them only because conventional statistical
	methods lack power. Using the new method of abcml (Analysis of Bone
	Counts by Maximum Likelihood), it is easy to distinguish assemblages
	that were deposited by different agents. It is also possible to distinguish
	between assemblages that have suffered differing degrees of attritional
	damage, but this distinction is more difficult to make. It is also
	shown that the conventional method for recognizing attritional damage
	in faunal assemblages is remarkably low in power. The paper closes
	with a discussion of the word "equifinality" itself.},

	Abstract = {To a first order of approximation, selection is frequency independent
	in a wide range of family structured models and in populations following
	an island model of dispersal, provided the number of families or
	demes is large and the population is haploid or diploid but allelic
	effects on phenotype are semidominant. This result underlies the
	way the evolutionary stability of traits is computed in games with
	continuous strategy sets. In this paper similar results are derived
	under isolation by distance. The first-order effect on expected change
	in allele frequency is given in terms of a measure of local genetic
	diversity, and of measures of genetic structure which are almost
	independent of allele frequency in the total population when the
	number of demes is large. Hence, when the number of demes increases
	the response to selection becomes of constant sign. This result holds
	because the relevant neutral measures of population structure converge
	to equilibrium at a rate faster than the rate of allele frequency
	changes in the total population. In the same conditions and in the
	absence of demographic fluctuations, the results also provide a simple
	way to compute the fixation probability of mutants affecting various
	ecological traits, such as sex ratio, dispersal, life-history, or
	cooperation, under isolation by distance. This result is illustrated
	and tested against simulations for mutants affecting the dispersal
	probability under a stepping-stone model.},

	Abstract = {Shapiro examines the theoretical study of style from an art historians
	point of view. Interestingly, in several places, he characterizes
	the patterning of style as language, both in the sense of the art
	historian interpreting its meaning and the sense of the style attempting
	ot communicate something to observers [parrallel with style as signalling].
	This is in an Anthropology volume done in 1953 and the article is
	aimed at both anthros and archys. Thus it is interesting that an
	art historian speaks to us about style; indicative of the colloquial
	treatment of style. Also there is a parallel between the many different
	art history theories of style and archaeological theories of style.
	1. Discusses style as a diagnostic marker for times and cultures.
	Can use the progression of styles to infer chronology 2. Style varies
	continuously and thus classifications miss the subtly involved in
	changing styles. 3. The analysis of style is strongly influecned
	by western conceptions [this would be a word to the wise for those
	who see style as social signalling]. Stlye is analyzed in terms of
	symbols and iconography. 4. NOtes that styles are defined by common
	qualities, but that there is a range of variation in a style. And
	these differences within a style often belong to different historical
	strata and thus are much like elelments of a language. 5. Discusses
	organic concept of style as one of growth and development. Discusses
	a development from natural forms in art on up. 6. Others theories
	of style attempt to explain changes in style in terms of cyclical
	developments [related to Kroeber 1919??]. Also notes that mechanical
	constraints of materials channel style. And that components of a
	style can exist across several media [Lapita?]. Also, style is a
	means of communication (language) of the patterns of thought of a
	group. 7. There are theories of art that discuss racial or geographic
	characteristics of art. 8. Finally, styles may reflects forms of
	social life, from egalitarian to marxism.},

	Abstract = {Summary: ROCR is a package for evaluating and visualizing the performance
	of scoring classifiers in the statistical language R. It features
	over 25 performance measures that can be freely combined to create
	two-dimensional performance curves. Standard methods for investigating
	trade-offs between specific performance measures are available within
	a uniform framework, including receiver operating characteristic
	(ROC) graphs, precision/recall plots, lift charts and cost curves.
	ROCR integrates tightly with R's powerful graphics capabilities,
	thus allowing for highly adjustable plots. Being equipped with only
	three commands and reasonable default values for optional parameters,
	ROCR combines flexibility with ease of usage.Availability: http://rocr.bioinf.mpi-sb.mpg.de.
	ROCR can be used under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
	Running within R, it is platform-independent.Contact: tobias.sing@mpi-sb.mpg.de},

	then frequency seriation is an appropriate method for deriving a
	chronological order of assemblages. If types measure time and, say,
	social status, then a frequency-seriation diagram will appear messy,
	or noisy, and deriving a chronological order will be less straightforward.
	Correspondence analysis (CA) can, when certain conditions are met,
	tease apart both temporal and nontemporal sources of variation. We
	explain why by highlighting the conceptual links between the models
	that are presupposed by CA and FS. The links imply that these methods
	are complementary and that, when used together, both can yield a
	deeper understanding of the causes of typefrequency variation than
	either can alone. We explore the practical implications for archaeological
	inference in two case studies of Middle and Late Woodland ceramic
	assemblages from sites located in the Deep South, primarily along
	the Gulf Coast and along the lower Chattahoochee and Apalachicola
	Rivers of Alabama, Georgia, and Florida.},

	was the first study of the Markovian time evolution of a system with
	infinitely many interacting components. In Section 1 it will be discussed
	in the light of recent progress in this field. The remaining Sections
	(2, 3, and 4) form an introduction to recent joint work with Thomas
	M. Liggett. They concern new types of systems where each component
	takes on a real value which fluctuates in a way depending linearly
	on the values of neighboring components. The ergodic theory for such
	systems with finitely many components is the subject of Section 2.
	The results suggest conjectures for the case of infinitely many components,
	stated in Section 3 and proved in the joint paper with T. Liggett
	(ibid.). Section 4 introduces another class of time evolutions whose
	ergodic behavior may be analyzed by similar methods.},

	In this paper, we discuss and apply an ABC method based on sequential

	to perform better than other ABC approaches. The algorithm is applied
	to several well-known biological systems, for which parameters and
	their credible intervals are inferred. Moreover, we develop ABC SMC
	as a tool for model selection; given a range of different mathematical
	descriptions, ABC SMC is able to choose the best model using the
	standard Bayesian model selection apparatus.},

	Abstract = {Observations of primate groups have shown that social learning can
	lead to the development of temporal stable traditions or even proto-culture.
	The social structure of primate groups is highly diverse and it has
	been proposed that differences in the group structure shall influence
	the patterns of social information transmission. While empirical
	studies have mainly focused on the psychological mechanisms of social
	learning in individuals, the phenomenon of information propagation
	within the group has received relatively little attention. This might
	be due to the fact that formal theories that allow actual testing
	have not been formulated, or were kept too simple, ignoring the social
	dynamics of multi-agent societies. We want to propose a network approach
	to social information transmission that (1) preserves the complexity
	of the social structure of primate groups and (2) allows direct application
	to empirical data. Results from simulation experiments with artificial
	group structures confirm that association patterns of group-members
	influence the expected speed of information transmission during the
	propagation process. Introducing a forgetting rate shows that under
	certain conditions the proportion of informed individuals will reach
	a stable rate in some systems while it will drop to zero in others.
	This suggests that the likelihood to observe temporal stable traditions
	shall differ between social systems with different structure.},

	Abstract = {The fossil record provides a lower bound on the primate divergence
	time of 54.8 million years ago, but does not provide an explicit
	estimate for the divergence time itself. We show how the pattern
	of diversification through the Cenozoic can be combined with a model
	for speciation to give a distribution for the age of the primates.
	The primate fossil record, the number of extant primate species,
	and information about the structure of the primate phylogenetic tree
	are combined to provide an estimate for the joint distribution of
	the primate and anthropoid divergence times. To take this information
	into account, we derive the structure of the birth-and-death process
	conditioned to have a subtree originate at a particular point in
	time. This process has a size-biased law and has an immortal line
	running from the root of the tree to the root of the subtree, with
	species on the spine having modified offspring and length distributions.
	We conclude that it is not possible, with this model, to rule out
	a Cretaceous origin for the primates.},

	Abstract = {Estimation of divergence times is usually done using either the fossil
	record or sequence data from modern species. We provide an integrated
	analysis of palaeontological and molecular data to give estimates
	of primate divergence times that utilize both sources of information.
	The number of preserved primate species discovered in the fossil
	record, along with their geological age distribution, is combined
	with the number of extant primate species to provide initial estimates
	of the primate and anthropoid divergence times. This is done by using
	a stochastic forwards-modeling approach where speciation and fossil
	preservation and discovery are simulated forward in time. We use
	the posterior distribution from the fossil analysis as a prior distribution
	on node ages in a molecular analysis. Sequence data from two genomic
	regions (CFTR on human chromosome 7 and the CYP7A1 region on chromosome
	8) from 15 primate species are used with the birth-death model implemented
	in mcmctree in PAML to infer the posterior distribution of the ages
	of 14 nodes in the primate tree. We find that these age estimates
	are older than previously reported dates for all but one of these
	nodes. To perform the inference, a new approximate Bayesian computation
	(ABC) algorithm is introduced, where the structure of the model can
	be exploited in an ABC-within-Gibbs algorithm to provide a more efficient
	analysis.},

	Abstract = {Fired-clay materials such as brick, tile and ceramic artefacts are
	found widely in archaeological deposits. The slow progressive chemical
	recombination of ceramics with environmental moisture (rehydroxylation)
	provides the basis for archaeological dating. Rehydroxylation rates
	are described by a (time) power law. A ceramic sample may be dated
	by first heating it to determine its lifetime water mass gain, and
	then exposing it to water vapour to measure its mass gain rate and
	hence its individual rehydroxylation kinetic constant. The kinetic
	constant depends on temperature. Mean lifetime temperatures are estimated
	from historical meteorological data. Calculated ages of samples of
	established provenance from Roman to modern dates agree excellently
	with assigned (known) ages. This agreement shows that the power law
	holds precisely on millennial time scales. The power law exponent
	is accurately 1 4, consistent with the theory of fractional (anomalous)
	‚{\"A}{\`o}single-file‚{\"A}{\^o} diffusion.},

@article{Smith:2007p2468,
	Abstract = {Temporal variation in ceramic-type frequencies often is used to order archaeological assemblages chronologically. Frequency seriation (FS) is one means to do this. If the pottery types used are historical, then frequency seriation is an appropriate method for deriving a chronological order of assemblages. If types measure time and, say, social status, then a frequency-seriation diagram will appear messy, or noisy, and deriving a chronological order will be less straightforward. Correspondence analysis (CA) can, when certain conditions are met, tease apart both temporal and nontemporal sources of variation. We explain why by highlighting the conceptual links between the models that are presupposed by CA and FS. The links imply that these methods are complementary and that, when used together, both can yield a deeper understanding of the causes of typefrequency variation than either can alone. We explore the practical implications for archaeological inference in two case studies of Middle and Late Woodland ceramic assemblages from sites located in the Deep South, primarily along the Gulf Coast and along the lower Chattahoochee and Apalachicola Rivers of Alabama, Georgia, and Florida.},

@article{lipomadsendunnell2015,
	Abstract = {<p>Frequency seriation played a key role in the formation of archaeology as a discipline due to its ability to generate chronologies. Interest in its utility for exploring issues of contemporary interest beyond chronology, however, has been limited. This limitation is partly due to a lack of quantitative algorithms that can be used to build deterministic seriation solutions. When the number of assemblages becomes greater than just a handful, the resources required for evaluation of possible permutations easily outstrips available computing capacity. On the other hand, probabilistic approaches to creating seriations offer a computationally manageable alternative but rely upon a compressed description of the data to order assemblages. This compression removes the ability to use all of the features of our data to fit to the seriation model, obscuring violations of the model, and thus lessens our ability to understand the degree to which the resulting order is chronological, spatial, or a mixture. Recently, frequency seriation has been reconceived as a general method for studying the structure of cultural transmission through time and across space. The use of an evolution-based framework renews the potential for seriation but also calls for a computationally feasible algorithm that is capable of producing solutions under varying configurations, without manual trial and error fitting. Here, we introduce the Iterative Deterministic Seriation Solution (IDSS) for constructing frequency seriations, an algorithm that dramatically constrains the search for potential valid orders of assemblages. Our initial implementation of IDSS does not solve all the problems of seriation, but begins to moves towards a resolution of a long-standing problem in archaeology while opening up new avenues of research into the study of cultural relatedness. We demonstrate the utility of IDSS using late prehistoric decorated ceramics from the Mississippi River Valley. The results compare favorably to previous analyses but add new details into the structure of cultural transmission of these late prehistoric populations.</p>},

	Abstract = {Constructing a confidence interval for the actual, conditional error rate of a prediction rule from multivariate data is problematic because this error rate is not a population parameter in the traditional sense--it is a functional of the training set. When the training set changes, so does this "parameter." A valid method for constructing confidence intervals for the actual error rate had been previously developed by McLachlan. However, McLachlan's method cannot be applied in many cancer research settings because it requires the number of samples to be much larger than the number of dimensions (n > p), and it assumes that no dimension-reducing feature selection step is performed. Here, an alternative to McLachlan's method is presented that can be applied when p > n, with an additional adjustment in the presence of feature selection. Coverage probabilities of the new method are shown to be nominal or conservative over a wide range of scenarios. The new method is relatively simple to implement and not computationally burdensome.},

	Abstract = {Anthropologists have adopted methods from population genetics to study modes of cultural transmission in time-transgressive cultural data sets. However, it remains unclear to what extent methods originally developed to assess neutrality in genes sampled from a population at a single point in time are applicable to cultural variants sampled from assemblages. This report applies a suite of previously published methods to assemblages formed under unbiased cultural transmission. The results show that, even under the controlled conditions afforded by computer simulation, all but one method (the variants frequency approach) fail to identify unbiased cultural transmission in samples collected from moderately to severely time-averaged assemblages. While it is encouraging that the method that is best at identifying unbiased cultural transmission in simulated time-averaged data also is relatively robust to relative sample size, additional work is needed to determine whether even the variants frequency approach is p...},

@article{Bonham:2009bi,
	Abstract = {It has been suggested that, during the Pliocene (ca 5-1.8Ma), an El Ni{\~n}o state existed as a permanent rather than an intermittent feature; that is, the tropical Pacific Ocean was characterized by a much weaker east-west gradient than today. One line of inquiry used to investigate this idea relates modern El Ni{\~n}o teleconnections to Pliocene proxy data by comparing regional differences in precipitation and surface temperature with climate patterns associated with present-day El Ni{\~n}o events, assuming that agreement between Pliocene data and observations of modern El Ni{\~n}o events supports this interpretation. Here, we examine this assumption by comparing outputs from a suite of Mid-Pliocene climate simulations carried out with the UK Met Office climate model. Regional patterns of climate change associated with changes in model boundary conditions are compared with observed El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation teleconnection patterns. Our results indicate that many of the proposed 'permanent El Ni{\~n}o' surface temperature and precipitation patterns are observable in Mid-Pliocene climate simulations even when they display variability in tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) or when forced with a modern east-west SST gradient. Our experiments highlight the possibility that the same outcome may be achieved through different initial conditions (equifinality); an important consideration for reconstructed patterns of regional Mid-Pliocene climate.},

@article{Rogers:2000bq,
	Abstract = {A faunal assemblage may be dominated by dense bones either because the soft ones have been transported away or because they have been gnawed beyond recognition. Archaeologists have often despaired of distinguishing between these hypotheses and have attributed the problem to equifinality-to the fact that different causes can produce identical outcomes. Yet under the models of transport and attrition studied here, these causes do not produce identical outcomes. It has been difficult to distinguish between them only because conventional statistical methods lack power. Using the new method of abcml (Analysis of Bone Counts by Maximum Likelihood), it is easy to distinguish assemblages that were deposited by different agents. It is also possible to distinguish between assemblages that have suffered differing degrees of attritional damage, but this distinction is more difficult to make. It is also shown that the conventional method for recognizing attritional damage in faunal assemblages is remarkably low in power. The paper closes with a discussion of the word "equifinality" itself.},

	Abstract = {Classification procedures are some of the most widely used statistical methods in ecology. Random forests (RF) is a new and powerful statistical classifier that is well established in other disciplines but is relatively unknown in ecology. Advantages of RF compared to other statistical classifiers include (1) very high classification accuracy; (2) a novel method of determining variable importance; (3) ability to model complex interactions among predictor variables; (4) flexibility to perform several types of statistical data analysis, including regression, classification, survival analysis, and unsupervised learning; and (5) an algorithm for imputing missing values. We compared the accuracies of RF and four other commonly used statistical classifiers using data on invasive plant species presence in Lava Beds National Monument, California, USA, rare lichen species presence in the Pacific Northwest, USA, and nest sites for cavity nesting birds in the Uinta Mountains, Utah, USA. We observed high classificati...},

	Abstract = {Summary: ROCR is a package for evaluating and visualizing the performance of scoring classifiers in the statistical language R. It features over 25 performance measures that can be freely combined to create two-dimensional performance curves. Standard methods for investigating trade-offs between specific performance measures are available within a uniform framework, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) graphs, precision/recall plots, lift charts and cost curves. ROCR integrates tightly with R's powerful graphics capabilities, thus allowing for highly adjustable plots. Being equipped with only three commands and reasonable default values for optional parameters, ROCR combines flexibility with ease of usage.Availability: http://rocr.bioinf.mpi-sb.mpg.de. ROCR can be used under the terms of the GNU General Public License. Running within R, it is platform-independent.Contact: tobias.sing@mpi-sb.mpg.de},

	Abstract = {Abstract In humans, cultural transmission occurs usually by cumulative inheritance, generating complex adaptive behavioral features. Cumulative culture requires key psychological processes (fundamentally imitation and teaching) that are absent or impoverished in non-human primates. In this paper we analyze the role that teaching has played in human cumulative cultural evolution. We assume that a system of cumulative culture generates increasingly adaptive behaviors, that are also more complex and difficult to imitate. Our thesis is that, as cultural traits become more complex, cumulative cultural transmission requires teaching to ensure accurate transmission from one generation to the next. In an increasingly complex cultural environment, we consider that individuals commit errors in imitation. We develop a model of cumulative cultural evolution in a changing environment and show that these errors hamper the process of cultural accumulation. We also show that a system of teaching between parents and offspring that increases the fidelity of imitation unblocks the accumulation and becomes adaptive whenever the gain in fitness compensates the cost of teaching. },
